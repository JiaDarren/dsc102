It is a Jazz quintet line up of Alto sax, guitar, piano, bass, and drums. It sounds like it was all recorded live, no studio tricks here. The more I listened to it the more it grew on me.

AA7P2NEC94K79,B0062P7ISY,J. Pappan,"[3, 3]","I had a really good run with my free home phone using the ObiTalk and Google Voice... almost three years of 100% free, reliable service. That all ends on May 15, 2014, when Google announced it will stop supporting the XMPP protocol, which is used by the ObiTalk devices. It couldn't last forever, I think I knew that.The next cheapest alternative I found was the MagicJack. They advertisement $19.95 a year, but in reality, it's $29.95 a year. If you want $19.95, you have to sign up for five years, which I wasn't about to do based on the not-so-great reviews and uncertainty of the service. With this purchase on Amazon, you get six months free, which is a great way to test the waters.Here's how my four star experience went: (skip to the bottom to get the short version)- I purchased the product through Amazon, it arrived quickly in a fairly small but irritating package which had to be cut out completely like a children's toy in Wal-Mart. No big deal.- I briefly read some instructions, which weren't great. Essentially, I just plugged in the device to a USB port on my iMac (yes, I'm using OS X 10.9) and plugged in the ethernet cable from my router (both cables are supplied by MJ). My plan was to run the MJ by itself, not dependent on a computer. If you plan to do this, you must still start by plugging it into your computer.- Nothing happened on plugging it in. Upon going to the MJ website, I discovered that every link I clicked resulted in a page not found 404 error. Great, the entire website was down. After an hour I went to bed. Not a great start.- Next morning, the website was up. I eventually found the Mac software by going to magicjack.com and then going to the FAQ. The MJ website is set up to attract new customers, not to support existing customers. I found the Mac software and installed, but it failed to find the MJ device. So I started my computer in Windows mode, and found the Windows driver package. I installed the package, and it too did not work.- So I went back to Mac OS, and this time I found a driver package labeled ""2014 magicJack PLUS"" under Mac downloads. After installing this and running the application, everything started to work. It walked me through setting up my device and selecting a phone number. I chose not to port my old number because I simply don't care about it. I also know that it's not just $10 to port, but the reviews indicate it's a huge hassle, and there's a $10 fee every year, not just during setup.- I did elect the $3 to pick my own number from a long list. About 5 minutes later my MagicJack was good to go. I unplugged it from my computer and plugged the USB cable into the supplied power adapter. My MJ runs completely on its own, 24/7. I use the phone several hours a day for work, and I've yet to have an interruption. No one complains of delays, like some other VOIP services.At this point, if this continues, I will lock in for 5 years to get the $19.99/yr plan.Short version:This is an incredibly cheap landline solution for the cost. Customer support is not good. They are set up to attract new customers, not keep current ones. Don't port a number, unless you can't live without it - you get charged $10/yr forever for this service. Expect to use some trial/error getting it up and running. Expect to hunt around on a few different websites for drivers/answers. If you can deal with this, go for it. Once I got through the pain of getting my number set up, I have been loving the MJ.Don't forget you can take this thing on the road with you, and your number travels along.  You just need an ethernet port, power adapter and your phone.Something else to remember - it isn't easy getting the MJ to service every phone jack in your house. You can do it, but you need to know what you're doing (like, digging around in the phone box on the side of your house, beware). Out of the box, this will only provide service for ONE phone. In my case, I have it plugged into my portable phone base, and I have several other portables around the house that depend on the base and don't plug into any wall jacks. This is probably the best way to go.",4.0,Replaced my free ObiTalk/Google Voice phone with this,1399507200.0,"05 8, 2014"

A29VOXYNYSHU4O,0517209772,Paul Snow,"[8, 46]","Asimov mostly gives pretty standard skeptic views of the Biblical texts.He commits all of the typical errors of such skeptics.  For example, he gives an analysis of the resurrection of Jesus as an event that rests on the witness of a few women.  Never mind that the texts of those accounts are contradictory and contradictory between the Gospels, and the one quoted by Asimov is actually missing from the earliest manuscripts.A true analysis would never draw historical conclusions from passages that are unlikely to have been part of the original texts. Any research at all would have avoided such a gaff.  Heck, my own study Bible points out that these passages are missing from the earliest manuscripts.Furthermore, Asimov's guide treats the Bible as a single book.  And yet the Bible is a collection of books written over at least 800 years by 60 or more authors.  Heck, even what books should be included are not universally understood across various groups of Christians.  Catholics include 7 more books that western protestants. See [...]Wouldn't you think that Asimov might have discussed this fact?  Should he not have presented what we understand to be historically factual, and what we understand to be mythical?  Shouldn't his analysis include the observation that even the earliest Christian Writers, such as Saint Augustine doubted the literal interpretations of Genesis?  Or that the oldest books of the collection include Job, a book with four chapters of God lecturing Job that he knows nothing about how the creation of the world was accomplished?  Such insights are completely missing from this ""guide"".And to be fair, many, many groups have used these texts for various purposes.  The very first Christians refused to join any army or police force, based on the pacifist readings of such texts as the Sermon on the Mount found in Matthew chapter 5.  The very first Baptists martyrs died demanding not just religious freedom for their own churches, but religious freedom for Muslims, Jews, and heretics (the common term in the 1600's for atheists).  And of course we have fundamentalism using the texts to oppose abortion, homosexuality, and evolution.  Does Asimov's guide give us insight into how some groups see religious freedom in the texts?  No.  Does he explain the roots of fundamentalism in the texts?  No.  Does he explain the pacifist and peace movements that arise from these texts?  No.A General Guide to the Bible ought to do some of this.  Should discuss how the texts have impacted history.  Should explain how the texts impact the present.  If you really want to understand the Bible in context, this book is useless.So what will you get if you read this ""guide""?  You will get the off the cuff observations of a cynical skeptic who (it seems) went out and bought a Bible, and dashed off many various common, unoriginal skeptic views to a few chosen passages into a very readable and engaging book.What you will not get is a researched, objective, fair, or insightful analysis of a library of religious and non religious texts that have done more to shape western thought, philosophy, and culture than any other collection of writings.  You will not get any discussion about how these texts have been understood historically.  You will not get any discussion about how these texts have driven various institutions such as the Catholic Church, the Protestant denominations, the Greek Orthodox Church, State Churches, etc.  You will not get the arguments for and against religious freedom, as found in these texts.  Or those over creationism.  Or over concepts like the trinity, or baptism, or communion.Really, you just won't get much.",1.0,A Guide for Those Uninterested in Objective Analysis,1357257600.0,"01 4, 2013"

They have already broken up so I don't see that happening anytime soon.  But I'm not saying I didn't like them while they were around. They put on great live shows.

And a lot of them have gotten very little recognition, such Revielle or the Phunk Junkeez.  3rd Stike pulls this off decently, but still have gotten virtually no recognition.

A2K2CHOLEUH4RC,B0090AAOUW,Dan the Saxman,"[1, 1]","I use my Note 2 as an MP3 player (I do a one man band show and need backing tracks) and needed a backup MP3 player in case the Samsung should fail.  After searching in the $100.00 or so price range I decided to take a chance with the I9220.  For the price of a decent dedicated MP3 player I like the extra goodies that comes with a smartphone.  I knew it wouldn't be a match for the Note 2, but since I really won't be using it as a phone I wasn't interested in it's 3G and 4G limitations.All I can say is that I'm impressed.  I loaded many of my Note 2 apps from the Google Play Store, which went without a hitch.  So far, no complaints on the headphone jack either, as others have commented on.  For people having a problem I suggest getting an iPhone adapter.  Early iPhones had recessed headphone jacks, and this phone likely requires such a jack.  I modified my jacks when I had an iPhone, so they work well with this phone.  Concerning sound quality out of the headphone jack, my preliminary tests show it has better sound than the Note 2.  I didn't expect that.  I need to do further testing, so don't hold me to this.  The onboard speaker lacks bass, but the volume is good enough.  The onboard camera is pretty bad, but I'm comparing it to the Note 2.Considering I paid over 5x's the price for the Note 2, I am very happy with this phone.  Time will tell if it will hold up, but for me it's just a backup device, so unless it goes bad while stored in a suitcase, it will likely last a very long time.BTW, whoever installed the screen protector did an excellent job.  Better than any I have ever installed.  I really didn't know it was on until I used a pair of strong reading glasses.UPDATE:  I just checked the ""about phone"" section on the phone and see that I got the GT-I9500.  No where does it mention the I9220.  Also, the baseband is MTK6515.  Android version is 4.2.2.  Whatever they call it, it's working great so far.  Lightahead was the seller, fullfilled through Amazon.For a good video describing this phone check: [...] or do a YouTube search for: N9000 DEMO1  My phone (black color) matches the phone shown with the on-off on the right side.  Also, mine didn't come with the ""comprehensive Android manual"" he mentions in the video.Update 10/30/13:  I took off one star for the viewing angle.  When viewing from the front of the camera, which is how I use it as an MP3 player, it's pretty bad.  My Samsung Note 2 kills in this respect, and you can see the difference in screen quality big time in this respect.  After extensive testing I can say for sure the audio chip in this phone is better than my in my ""real"" Note 2.  This has become my primary MP3 player, with the Note 2 being used as a backup.Sorry for not reviewing the phone call capabilities, and all I can say is it does work as a phone, since I tried it with my Note 2 sim card.  In all other respects it continues to work as a dependable device.  Maybe I just got lucky and got one of the ""good ones"".",4.0,Better than expected!,1381795200.0,"10 15, 2013"

Rowling presents us with ""The Half-Blood Prince"", a story with all the lightness of a lead coffin.While it is neither as plodding nor as cartoonish as its predecessor, this is no beach book.The few light interludes focus on the pleasures and pitfalls of romance--between witches, wizards, werewolves, and part-Veelas.The overarching atmosphere, however, is one of gloom, abounding in vivid descriptions of violence, pain, torture, and general bloodletting.In spite of all this, however, this book pulls off two nearly impossible feats; making readers feel some sympathy for the vile Draco Malfoy and giving them some insight into the grief felt by the earliest readers of Dickens' ""Old Curiosity Shop"" over thedeath of Little Nell.Rowling is often accused of being derivative, and, unfortunately, ""The Half-Blood Prince"" gives those critics plenty of ammunition.

It's pretty sad that after decades of making shoes, they can't fix this PROBLEM.For reference, I'm a 155lb, mid foot/heel 'glider' that's light on my feet and have used the shoes up to now for close to 20 hrs total use on moderate to technical trail.",4.0,Initially fit a bit small but stretched after time.,1375401600.0,"08 2, 2013"

This book was so stinking charming, I was completely swept away by it. No wonder the book has climbed to the quarter finals in the romance category of the 2013 Amazon Breakthrough Novel Award. (More information: amazon.com/abna) I loved every single moment. The characters were charming, their lives were charming, the town of Saffron Sweeting was charming. It was so charming, I wanted to climb into the pages as I read and live among the characters. I wanted to walk into Grace Palmer's English cottage, ""put the kettle on"" and sit with her and tell her everything will be okay.The richness of the book reminded me a lot of Under the Tuscan Sun by Frances Mayes and the books by Peter Mayle set in Provence. If you love books set in a quirky little town with villagers that stake their claims on the story and a main character that struggles with internal conflict while falling in love with the beautiful but flawed surroundings of a town she haphazardly found her way to, then this is the book for you.Grace Palmer certainly received a punch in the stomach (not literally) in the opening pages when she learns of her husband's affair. But she picks herself up, dusts herself off, and returns to her home country of England only to find herself in the turmoil of changing times in the town of Saffron Sweeting.The people Grace meets in the town of Saffron Sweeting are all so wonderful as characters in a book. Each play a different role in Grace's life and each bring different elements to the storyline. What is so captivating about the story of this town is the mingling of two cultures. An American bio-tech firm is relocating American workers to Saffron Sweeting and the villagers who have always called Saffron Sweeting home are trying to adapt. Because Grace Palmer is the only person in town with insights into both cultures, she is quickly placed in the heart of the small town and must play the role of assistant, consultant and guide.I finished reading this book while on a weekend trip to Boston. I told everyone I saw on this trip about the book, even the passengers sitting on the plane beside me, imploring them to pick up a copy and start reading. It was that enjoyable, from cover to cover.Highly recommended. Run, don't walk. Or better yet, click.

AIFWCOS6FFYCV,B004VN09LM,Nathan Deunk,"[0, 0]","The Good:1. I didn't pay much.2. It holds the phone securely, whether in or out of the holster.3. When in the holster, it seems almost bulletproof.4. The felt on the inside was very soft and doesn't scratch the screen.5. It can slide into the holster face in or face out - although face out is much more difficult.6. It stands up and is quite stable in either orientation, which is the first time I've seen this in this type of case.7. It has a slightly rubberized belt clip with a strong spring that doesn't come off!The Bad:1. The phone jiggles EVER so slightly in the sleeve when it's not in the holster. It's still QUITE secure, but it could be annoying to some.2. Some people might have issues with the felt collecting dust, but I've been using it for 5 months in Djibouti and have had no problems.3. It doesn't protect the ends very well when you slide it out of the holster.4. While the plastic is grippy on your skin, on other surfaces it can be quite slick, so a tilted, hard, slick surface may not be the best place to put your phone.5. It has a slightly rubberized belt clip with a strong spring that doesn't come off!Conclusion: While I love the idea of the case, the sleeve didn't seem substantial enough to use without carrying around the holster, and the belt clip just gets in the way! I ended up snapping off the belt clip and doing an unconventional mod of the case. Turns out that if you take the button that holds the belt clip off and cut the felt in the middle, you can slide it in there and glue it down, which makes the holster much slimmer. However, this mod will ensure that you will never put any belt clip on it again. Good luck with your search for the perfect iPhone 4 case and thanks for reading!Update: I have used this case now for almost 5 months in the desert of Djibouti. After I snapped off the belt clip to make it smaller, it really worked well for me, providing just enough protection without feeling bulky. I highly recommend it, and it has become my favorite case for my iPhone by a large margin.

A3PV68UKJI1UVH,B002UAR8SK,K. Frazier,"[3, 3]","This netbook is great for a cheap small, very portable, tablet. Of course it's a netbook so expecting great performance, even out of the box, is just setting yourself up to be disappointed. I bought this netbook just over a month ago. I use it for school and simple things at home. It's good for research and note taking (I got MS office and I use OneNote on it). I use google chrome on it and it's pretty fast with this browser. I can't tell you how well it worked with the default RAM it came with because before I even turned it on I replaced the 1gb RAM stick with a 667mhz 2gb corsair stick I had bought that was shipped to my house the day before. I have had no problems with it, so no need to switch back. Like many other reviews for this netbook, I suggest you immediately upgrade to a 2gb stick of RAM.The design of this netbook is very nice (not as nice or as large as the t101mt, but I'll tell you why I chose this over the t101 later) and light. While it only has 2 USB ports you can get external add-ons (and if you need something that consumes power, then you'll need to get one that plugs into a wall outlet or has a battery pack). I have had no problems with the swiveling screen and while there is a long delay when using the button that changes the screen orientation, it's not difficult to use. The stylus is a bit annoying. It extends and will easily go back to it's normal position without having to make it (just hold it upwards). The 2 SD slots is a nice plus due to the lack of 3 USB ports. Not only that but one has a cover to make it semi-permanant. I assume this is done because there's not much hard drive space (only 32gb). The keyboard is difficult to type on first, but it doesn't take long to learn how to type on. because the keys are small it's very easy to ""fat-finger"" the keys when you type too fast (I do that a lot when I'm typing in my user-password and it takes it awhile to tell me that I typed in the incorrect password). I'm happy that they put a caps-lock LED indicator, and while they're not necessary, there are functions on the keyboard for num lock and scroll lock (some of the normal keys, when num lock is on, will function as a number pad). The camera is hardly worth mentioning. It's terrible. It's slow to capture and is 0.2 megapixels in picture capture mode. Though I didn't have a need for it in the first place so it's not a big con for me. The screen, while small, has a better PPI (pixels per sqaure inch) than most other netbooks. it's the same resolution as others but a smaller screen. That's one reason I chose it over the t101mt, also it's not very grainy.The touchscreen is nice, the multi touch features are mostly swiveling and resizing. I do recommend getting rid of some of asus' software like touchgate and the software dock. They're unnecessary and use quite a few resources (especially touchgate). However penwrite is useful, well, the t101mt version of penwrite is useful. I recommend going to the download page on Asus' website for the t101mt and downloading and installing its version of penwrite. that will allow you the option of getting palm rejection on every software, not just one note and a few other softwares. You do this by setting it into pen mode. Now there are a few problems I've had with it. When I have my palm rested on the screen while trying to write, it will reject everything, that includes whatever I'm trying to write with the pen (or draw).Now for overall performance in my very long review. Of course you can't expect too much, considering it's a netbook, but the intel GMA 500 is terrible, or well.. the intel GMA 500 DRIVERS are terrible. I can run video game emulators up to the graphics level of the SNES, however, when I tried playing megaman zero 1 (I'm a bit of a fan) on the visual boy advance emulator, on the second stage there is an overlay of what is supposed to be rain, however my graphics chip couldn't understand the overlay and completely omitted the game and just displayed the rain overlay which made it impossible to play. Now I tried the same emulator with the EXACT same rom (put the rom on a flash drive) and played it on my desktop and had no such problem. The emulator was also extremely slow. I've also had problems with visual clones of applications. One of which was a desktop gadget monitoring CPU usage and Memory usage. I was able to easily get rid of the clone by moving my mouse over it, forcing a reset of the sector of the screen the mouse was over. Now to increase performance, I recommend turning off windows aero and turning your graphics settings to either basic or classic (I'm using classic right now). I also recommend having it plugged in whenever possible for performance. Getting linux on here (from what I've read) is a nightmare. It mostly has to do with the linux graphics drivers for the intel GMA 500 being terrible (look up the Dell mini 10 ubuntu netbooks and search for articles relating to it not working). The reason it's terrible is that intel didn't actually make the chip, another company did and intel just puts their name on it. Now also to get it to work on linux, you have to compile your own driver so the touchscreen will work in linux. The first is a more difficult task than the second of course. I have had no problems with my after market memory. Of course with a processor operating at 1.33ghz, there are going to be programs crashing if you ask it to run too much (I had one note do that when I asked it to undo too much). The battery life is AMAZING. if I use it conservatively with low brightness settings, it lasts about 5 hours (on power saver mode). about 3 hours if I play music or video games (which is annoying if I'm playing chess with a friend).If you're going to listen to music, you should use headphones instead of the speakers. the speakers are on the underside of the netbook and also have low sound quality. Videos are a bit laggy (I get low frame rates on youtube on the lowest possible resolution) however I usually get no lag on sound (unless there's a high resource process running)the Bluetooth feature is very nice since I don't have a connector for my phone to a computer. The hard drive is slow (don't be fooled by the fact that it's an SSD) and only has 32gb (that's actually the marketed amount, there's less after formatting it to the NTFS filesystem, the true total is 29.7GB) of storage space. I don't store that many files on here and I don't have a lot of software and I only have 10gb remaining (while running piriform's CCleaner). I do highly recommend getting a high capacity SD card to store files on if you get this product. I would NOT use the online data storage asus provides, the interface for it has crashed windows explorer every time I try to set up an update with itif you have reached this far, I thank you and commend you for reading the entire review of this product.

The reason for this isthat this book teaches how to understand the strategic and positional ideas behind each opening.Without this knowledge, an opening is merely a series of meaningless moves, and the first time anopponent varies from book, one is left floundering for a plan, or some tactical solution which maynever be found. If this book is truly mastered, it is probably all a club player would ever need.But if concrete variations are desired, then it could be followed up profitably with MCO, or somesuch compilation of variations.

King,"[2, 3]","My original review can be found at: [...]The best summary of the message of Linchpin can be found on page 174:""You must become indispensable to thrive in the new economy. The best ways to do that are to be remarkable, insightful, an artist, someone bearing gifts. To lead. The worst way is to conform and become a cog in a giant system.""This is, at some level, rather obvious, of course. Seth spends a lot of time explaining the gift economy and the lizard brain and what he means by making art. And all of this is pretty good stuff. But what it all comes down to is this: If you want to succeed as an employee, as an employer, as a person, you need to stand out from the crowd by exceeding expectations and giving freely your best work, even if less will do. Hardly earth-shattering stuff, but worth repeating.A problem Seth has with his books is that he rarely tells you how he thinks you can achieve the very high bars he sets. Just that you need to meet them. Somehow. This is a problem that Seth himself mentions in Linchpin:""One of my favorite negative reviews of my book Tribes: 'Godin doesn't explain how to go about doing the actual hard groundwork of leadership. He makes it sound like anyone with an idea and  a cell phone can rally thousands of people to their cause in minutes if they just realize it's not hard'. My response: Telling people leadership is important is one thing. Showing them step by step precisely how to be a leader is impossible.""Linchpin works the same way. He tells you that *being indispensable* is important, and why, but stops short of telling you how. That would be impossible. Which makes Linchpin much more of a ""get off your butt and do something"" inspirational-style book than a ""here's a bunch of things you can do to make your life better"" self-help book.",3.0,"Inspirational, but obvious",1270512000.0,"04 6, 2010"

A24BYG0GAFVQJR,0141331879,Criss,"[0, 0]","""Limitele spiritului"" este volumul 5 din seria ""Academia vampirilor"", carte care mi-a placut enorm de mult. A fost plina de suspans, actiune, emotie si iubire :) Rose isi da testele de gardian, in urma carora obtine cel mai mare  punctaj. Pur si simplu este fenomenala la acest capitol - de mi-ar fi si mie la fel de simplu la examen : )Oricum, ajunsa gardian,viata ei ia cu totul si cu totul alta turnura Problemele de aceasta data sunt mult mai grave, si sa va explic de ce. Rose are un nou obiectiv: vrea sa-l faca pe Dimitri, de fapt, nu-l face, si-l readuce la starea lui initiala de dhampir. Problema e ca secretul acestei transformari este detinut de Robert, fratele maleficului Vikton Dashkov, care acum este inchis intr-o inchisoare de maxima securitate. Chiar asa, Eddie, Lissa si Rose pornesc dupa Viktor, pentru a-l elibera din Tarasov - si chiar reusesc !Esentialul este ca pentru a transforma un strigoi in dhampir este necesar ca strigoiul sa fie ucis cu o tepusa vrajita de spirit, si sa-i fie implantata in inima de acelasi utilizator al spiritului. Intorsi la Academie, Rose si ceilalti (inclusiv Adrian care li se alatura ) sunt pedepsiti. Partea asta mi s-a parut pur si simplu enervanta - cu pedeapsa - nu ca ar fi vina autoarei, insa ma enerveaza genul de personaje care arunca in stanga si-n dreapta cu acuzatii si pedepse. Daca in romanele trecute Rose era aia care ascundea chestii de Lissa, acum situatia s-a inversat, Lissa fiind mica secretoasa.Tot acest farmec ar trebui sa aibe loc pana la urmatorul atac al lui Dimitri, insa se pare ca el loveste din nou, ca strigoi, si cu toate ca Rose si Eddie au avut ocazia sa-l omoare, Rose l-a impiediat - ce sa faci cand iubesti pe cineva intratat de mult ? Ca oglindire in lumea reala, am observat sa Rose este modelul dupa care ar trebui cu totii sa ne luam - mai mult sau mai putin -. Ea nu este perfecta. Daca in primele doua carti am zis ca este prea super-eroina, apoi se intampla mai incolo sa decada intr-atat doar din cauza iubirii. Oricum ar fi, pe un grafic al evolutiei, ea devine din ce in ce mai buna, mai priceputa, mai inteligenta simai ambitioasa(daca este posibil ) . Lissa, prietena ei cea mai buna, ii este mereu alaturi, si pot spune ca mi-a placut mult de ea.Nu am avut o parere prea buna in privinta relatiei Rose- Adrian deoarece, cu toate ca el este indragostit de ea, Rose nu-l iubeste cu adevarat.""Limitele spiritului"" a fost plina de actiune, avand un titlu ideal si extrem de sugestiv. Mi-a placut ! A fost foarte buna ! Si inainte de a incheia aceasta recenzie, va mai spun ceva: Dimitri o sa atace din nou. Iar de data asta .. oare il pot salva sau va trebui sa fie ucis ? Si mai mult, oare este reala toata aceasta chestie cu salvarea sau doar isi risca vietile personajele in mod iinutil ?",5.0,A wonderful book !,1357776000.0,"01 10, 2013"

Grace and Beatrice so obviously did.  This book is a brilliant illustration of how the system fails us.  (Although, I must admit, I'm not 100% convinced that Schlictmann wasn't at least partly to blame.  I think the big payoff was his ultimate motivation-and his greed was, finally, his downfall.)I also felt amazed at how Harr was able to create such excitement around every motion filed, deposition taken and objection sustained or overruled.  It was as compelling as any thriller I've ever read.  I'm no legal expert, but I can see how this book would be extremely useful to any first-year law student.  Harr's research is impeccable; he really brought the most minute legal and technical details to light in a straightforward and reasonably objective manner.In closing, while W.R. Grace and Beatrice sleazed their way through this debacle without having to admit guilt, the Woburn families affected by this tragedy can feel somewhat vindicated in that anyone who reads A CIVIL ACTION will surely be convinced that Grace and Beatrice are truly at fault.",5.0,A small victory for the people of Woburn,978480000.0,"01 3, 2001"

A350IYXKKU2LW1,0316154601,memomoment,"[0, 0]","Veteran crime novelist Michael Connelly is in fine form with ""Lost Light,"" his 2003 entry in the detective Harry Bosch series.The novel begins eight months after the Los Angeles homicide detective retired, as Bosch turns his attention to an unsolved case that still haunts him.Angella Benton was killed on her 24th birthday, in the vestibule of her own apartment building. Three days later, $2 million in cash was stolen by gunmen in a spectacular, and bloody, heist from a movie shoot overseen by the company where Benton was a lowly worker. After Bosch and his partners were pulled from the case, the new team never made any progress, and the case all but died when one of the investigators was killed and the other was paralyzed in a lunchtime shootout at a bar.Nearly as soon as Bosch starts tugging at loose threads in the four-year-old homicide, he discovers plenty of seemingly related irregularities, including the disappearance of a federal agent and the detention of a terrorism suspect. A former colleague warns Bosch to drop the Benton case, but it will take more than that -- and more than some strong-arm tactics by a secretive U.S. government task force -- to deter the detective...It's been years since I read a murder mystery, and my reintroduction to Connelly was a bit shaky at first. Although I remember having read and enjoyed one Harry Bosch novel, the writing at the start of ""Lost Light"" seemed flat. Soon enough, however, the story kicks in, and the book swept me up and took me along for the ride.Interestingly, the book seems a bit dated, and not just because Bosch is a confirmed technophobe who doesn't even own a computer, let alone know how to use one. ""Lost Light"" was written before the start of the Iraq war, and the book represents an effort by the crime novelist to wrestle with the tradeoff between civil liberty and security that has been an issue in America since the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.That discussion is still relevant, but the issue seems strangely innocent and depoliticized in the context of ""Lost Light."" I noticed no mention of any political party or of the name of then-President George W. Bush. This seems remarkable given how bitter the discourse has been over him and his successor.And even though the federal government lavishes some unwanted attention on Bosch, I had trouble believing the detective was in genuine jeopardy. By contrast, Bosch seemed much more vulnerable during the parts of the book in which he attempts a reconciliation with his ex-wife.Still, this was a fun escapist read and worth the time.",4.0,Connelly weaves murderous web,1336089600.0,"05 4, 2012"

So for my chin, I had to angle it a bunch of different ways till it grabbed each hair. I also found it hurt less after a hot shower when my pores were more open.Wow...it really hurts.

A1OME2PFEMOSFQ,B0000014RF,"Michael R. Powell ""digital_picker""","[0, 0]","Two problems exist when it comes to buying a soundtrack CD for this film.  The first, as with all score CDs it seems, is to make sure you don't end up with a bootleg.  Granted, it is simply a fact of life for score collectors that some material can only be found on these ""import""/""limited edition""/""promo""/""expanded"" score CDs, but the problem with bootlegs is that in the event of an official release, it muddies the market in terms of what is worth buying, and for what price.The other issue isn't necessarily unique to this film, but is just due to the combination of rock music and score pieces found on the original Varese Sarabande CD.  The short answer when it comes to what I'd recommend for anyone wanting a ""complete"" score for this film is to buy the recently-released Intrada CD.  However, for true completists it's not that simple.  The reason I've purchased the Varese Sarabande version and not the Intrada release is because Intrada did not include the rock tracks on their CD.  It may have been a licensing issue, or simply due to limited space.  Intrada's release of the Manhunter soundtrack also featured a track by Red 7, but I suppose these are licensed differently.  I assume it might just have been a matter of focusing on the score tracks, and for anyone who is a collector of score CDs that should probably suffice.For me, the goal was to obtain a properly-mastered version of the song ""Less Than Perfect"" by Red 7, since the CD release of their album on the Renaissance label was sub-standard at best, with ""Less Than Perfect"" being particularly affected by a lack of low end and what sounds like clipping distortion throughout.  I was disappointed to find that the version on this CD is somewhat remixed, so that it doesn't begin with the pumping bass line that started off the album version, and that the bass on this CD is only marginally better than that on the Renaissance release.  It's still nice to have, but not what I was expecting.  As for the score pieces, I could take or leave them... I never saw the film, but I do like electronic music, so some of the ""synth junk"" another reviewer alluded to might be appealing.The most important point to get across is that bootlegs of this and MANY other soundtracks abound.  As someone who has spent more than 20 years working in radio, the fact that these bootlegs are often labeled as ""promo only"" to avoid detection personally offends me.  If someone offers you a ""promo"" score CD, ask yourself ""why would a promotional CD of this material be issued?""  Remember that ALL promos come from the rights holders... there are NO ""unofficial"" promos, so if they're not released by the record company who owns the rights to the score, avoid buying them.  Obviously Varese Sarabande and Intrada license material from the rights holders, but even if a release appears to be from one of those labels, it's worth checking online to see if a particular title is indeed part of that label's catalog.  There are some very skilled graphic artists involved in creating fake score CDs, so you really have to do your homework and check out EVERYTHING.  As I said before, sometimes an unofficial release is the only source for some material, but in cases where official releases have been made, you could end up spending too much on a fake CD only to potentially find the official version later, possibly for a lower price.",3.0,"Avoid bootlegs, define ""complete"" before you buy...",1320105600.0,"11 1, 2011"

A14DV5W2N1EAJJ,1416572260,Daryl Anderson,"[112, 114]","If you are a real teacher (or principal or dean) in a real school, this humane and engaging book will surprise you with its combination of practicality and idealism. It will inspire you to change things and to believe in the possibility of change.After teaching for eight years, I have spent the last three as ""the discipline guy"", Dean of Students, in a small, rural middle school. As both teacher and now as dean I have developed a deep suspicion of a certain sort of books. You know the ones: written by theoreticians or one-on-one therapists who have never had to juggle a roomful of 25 actual young human beings with not enough time, not enough resources and far too much of paperwork, testing, and ringing bells; and more and more deeply-troubled youngsters. These are the books that anxious or angry and frustrated parents bring to meetings that tell them how you should be meeting the needs of their unsuccessful or disruptive child. These books make things far worse for everyone involved.""Lost at School"" is different; and that's clear from the beginning. After a brief introduction which pulls no punches in saying ""school discipline is broken"" the book launches into a story! Every teacher I know likes a good story - and this one feels so much like real (school)-life from the beginning that it sets the hook for the rest of the book. The different thing about this story is not the characterization of the troubled and challenging kids, but of its inclusion of the realistic range of adult personalities that combine to make education what it is - and sometimes isn't. The book sets out to follow the path of a handful of youngsters and another handful of fictional teachers and administrators who are struggling with the limitations of their own range of personalities and world-views as well as the real constraints of what schools can and cannot do. It is quite eye-opening and, in my opinion, dead-on accurate.Now don't let me give the impression that this book is just another entertaining ""Up the Down Staircase"" or ""Room 222"" or even merely another inspirational ""Stand and Deliver"". ""Lost at School"" is ultimately focused on a suite of methods for understanding children who exhibit challenging behaviors in school and for working with them to help them change. The ""storyline"" serves as an opportunity to view those methods in action as used by some fictionalized but well-drawn characters.The core assumptions of Greene's approach are that behaviorally challenging youngsters (a) ""know how we want them to behave"" and (b) ""want to behave the right way"". They don't need us to keep depriving them of privileges or offering them rewards to learn these two bits.The basic premise of the book is that these youngsters lack specific thinking skills which make it difficult or impossible for them to behave in circumstances that come up too-frequently in their school lives. Much as education has come-around in the past 20 years to acknowledge that cognitive deficits, learning disabilities, must be acknowledged as part of a youngster's learning of reading or mathematics, we need to move to a similar approach with behavioral difficulties.The goal, then, for educators, parents and the students, is to identify these missing or lagging cognitive skills and help students develop them - as central parts of their education.  Greene provides an inventory which will remind educators of the sorts of rubrics we use frequently, for instance, in assessing students for attention or hyperactivity disorders. Some of these skills may well have come up in your conversations about a difficult student, e.g. ""difficulty handling transitions"". Some of them have probably been parts of conversations about students without the notion that they ought to be taught, e.g. ""difficulty considering likely outcomes or consequences of actions"". And some of them might just not have occurred to you as loci of behavioral challenges, e.g. ""difficulty taking into account situational factors that would suggest the need to adjust a plan of action"". Rarely, though, have you or I managed to systematically think about what to do with these anecdotal observations.Having worked through the assessment of lagging skills, the next task is to ""teach"" these skills. In this regard Greene shifts gears and does not provide a ""curriculum"". Instead he provides an approach - a way of communicating with behaviorally challenging youngsters that he terms ""Collaborative Problem Solving"" or CPS. Some might find this unsatisfying. I did, at first; hoping for a ""methods"" approach to teaching this as any other group of skills. But I found Greene's system ultimately satisfying and revealing instead. He gives us CPS and weaves his ongoing story of sixth-grader Joey into its explicationThe CPS approach is interesting because it sounds so simple. Greene calls it simply ""Plan B"";  distinguishing from ""Plan A"" - wherein the teacher or institution imposes its will on the student, and from ""Plan C"" in which we ""drop an expectation completely, at least temporarily"".  I have to compliment Green on boldly sticking to such a simple naming scheme instead of coming up with typical ed-psych jargon to describe his schema or its alternatives. But the real power of such a simply-named approach is that describing it reveals how much we are all rooted in bouncing between poorly-implemented versions of plans A and C as part of school discipline. The ""Plan B"" or CPS approach assumes and requires listening to and the meaningful participation of the student -- and that is revealed to be a deeply-buried skill of even the well-intentioned educators in the storyline. But it can be learned and is the key to making things work.Greene is very open to all the ways things can go awry in dealing with real kids in real school environments. He peppers the book with ""Q&A;"" sections, and sample dialogues. But central to his acknowledgement of the ""real world"" is his fictional one! He weaves in, throughout, the ongoing tale of Joey and Mrs. Woods; of the Assistant Principal who got knocked in the jaw by Joey back in chapter one; of Joey's anguished mom and even of Mr. Armstrong, the ""these kids just have to learn how to behave"" guy, whom seems so familiar to any educator. This side-story becomes in many ways a central one as all of these people move through a year of struggle and transformation.I won't tell you how it ends but will reassure you that it does end, as most school years to, not with a bang of disaster or triumph but with a deep breath and a look ahead as all the good but flawed folks involved anticipate the next year's labors. In this Greene manages to honor the motives and efforts of everyone who chooses to work in the often thankless business of education while he deftly reminds us of how much better we could and should be doing with these youngsters.",5.0,"Not the Usual ""fix my kid"" Book: Deeply Humane and Engaging",1227312000.0,"11 22, 2008"

I have to say that most books I review end with me telling you that it's a good book, but this is NOT the case this time. This is not a good book, it's a fantastic book!I consider myself pretty versed in HTML 4 Transitional code, but HTML 5 is a whole different monster. I looked at it a while back but it wasn't very mature at the time. Things have changed a bit now. There are more browsers that support it now and the support is much better. More and more websites are offering great HTML 5 content and there is some really amazing stuff I have seen it do. I just had to get my feet wet a little more.This book, the HTML5 Developer's Cookbook, is a great way to get into this new form of web programming. I really dig the whole ""cookbook"" concept, which has some well annotated and defined ""recipes"" for accomplishing different tasks. You get great directions on everything from HTML 5 basic layout, to HTML 5 forms and much much more. This book starts with some forward information on what HTML 5 is and what it is not, a little history and background. It follows with, basically, 2 sections. Practically half the book is devoted to straight HTML 5 layout, tags, element changes, forms, css and media embedding, and the second, more advanced half of the book covers a wide variety of very useful API's. Things like drag and drop support and SQL support all the way up through really advanced things like media capture and geo-location.It took me a long time to get through this book, mostly because i really wanted to try a bunch of this stuff myself and there are a lot of code examples (those recipes again).

It has a lot of recipes, and sometimes several variations of similar things (like several different stew recipes, several different beef stroganoff recipes, etc). It must have a few hundred recipes or more.  Each page has probably 4 or 5 recipes on it- it's really a LOT of recipes!! I like the variety and choice.  It appears the recipes were submitted by individuals, and I find most of the meals are more 'traditional' meals.  Many of the meals are hearty and heavy, and probably not the most health concious, but they definitely remind me of the kind of meals I grew up eating.Most of the recipes involve very little prep work, and you can just sort of throw the ingrediants in and go.  Some slow coooker cookbooks have you cook and prepare for 1 1/2 hours before you even start slow cooking- and  that sort of defeats the purpose for me.  I slow cook because I work a 9 hour day and commute 1 1/2 hours each way.  After being gone 12 hours, and getting home late, I can't always cook a full meal.  These recipes are so easy I can throw the ingrediants in the slow cooker  at 10pm at night and put the slow cooker in the refrigerator overnight.  Then, the next morning, I pull the slow cooker out of the fridge, plug it in and go to work.  Dinner is ready by the time I get home.This is a good beginner slow cooker cookbook.  It doesn't have anything in it that I would call innovative or groundbreaking, but it's a good place to start.

Starring Jeremy Sisto, it follows the life of the future Dictator of Rome from his relative obscurity to his death at the hands of his peers on the Senate floor on the Ides of March in 44BC.The story covers the highlights of Caesar's life including his exile during the rule of the cruel dictator Sulla, his patronage under the capable General Pompey, his brutal but victorious campaigns against Vercingetorix and the Gauls, and his love affair with the beautiful and scheming Egytian queen Cleopatra.  Caesar's great ambition ultimately lead to his own murder by members of the Roman Senate who fear his ascendency, but ironically bring about the rise of the Empire.There are many political complexities that are touched upon in this film that give a good idea of the kinds of power plays that lead to Caesear's rise and fall, many of them including betrayal and murder.  The film depicts the Gallic Wars in good detail and gives an understanding of the turmoil that faced the Roman Republic in its last years before the rise of the Empire.  Caesar is portrayed as a intelligent human figure who is struck down by tragedy and overcome with amibition which ultimately leads to his own death.  The irony of Caesar's murder is that it was ostensibly to preserve the Republic, but rather hastened the foundation of the Empire.

A2MRMWRVCRX1CT,1400204224,James R. V. Matichuk,"[11, 12]","My view of angels is complicated. I was raised in an evangelical home and have always believed in angels and the part they played in the biblical story; however I was taught to be suspicious of tales of modern day angelic visitations, and to doubt the lore which was built around angels, because so much of it was New Age, Mormons, or Muslim. As a child I was tucked in with a prayer that asked God to send his angels to look after me, but if anybody started talking about experiencing angels, that was a good indication that they were a heretic or they needed to up their medication.When I was in college, I attended a charismatic church which affirmed the experiential reality of a super natural God-everything God did in scripture was for today and that included angels and angelic visitations. I remember one guest speaker at our church explaining that he felt the presence of `angels in the room' by a sensation he had in his sinus cavity(yep, I kid you not). Others saw angels, or `felt them.' I did feel the reality of God's presence at that church but the lack of critical thinking about spiritual experiences was disturbing.Joel Miller has written a book on angels which deftly guides readers past the extremes of supernatural suspicion and belief in anything and everything `angelic.' Drawing generously on Biblical and patristic sources (early church theologians), he gives an account of how the early church thought and taught about angels. He asserts that `the image that forms from these sources is, I think, more exciting, more frightening, more humbling, more inspiring, and ultimately more real than our popular conceptions.(2)' Miller discusses the early church's reflections on the nature and origin of angels, their fall from grace (in the case of Satan and his demons), the ways God used angels to nurture and protect Israel, Christs victory over the demonic, the role of guardian angels in nurturing and protecting us, our participation with the angels in the worship of God, the role of angels in the eschaton.This is a lot of ground to cover for a short book (the main text of the book is 152 pages excluding footnotes and bibliography); nevertheless Miller succeeds admirably well in delineating the understanding of angels bequeathed us from the early church, even demonstrating the way our understanding of angels has developed over time. Certainly there are some aspects of early church angel-ology where I disagree or would want to parse biblical texts which deal with angels differently. But there is no denying, the tradition has a lot to teach us.  I would recommend this book for those who have an interest in angels (whether that manifests itself as an unhealthy fascination or dismissive suspicion).  Part of navigating how we are to understand something so mysterious and etheral as angels is by submitting ourselves to a biblical understanding of angels and drawing on the rich resources of theology.  Miller does both.The question that the discerning reader may have is, ""how does ancient exegesis shape our understanding of angels?"" Just because ancient Christians thought and taught something, does not necessarily make it right. This is a popular level study and does little in way of evaluating its sources. Miller simply sites church fathers he is sympathetic to(while noting theological diversity and doctrinal development).  The belief in the fall of Lucifer is found in the ancient church, but when you read Isaiah in its historic, literary context, the Biblical data doesn't seem conclusive. There seems to be mysteries here that even the ancient church does not fully untangle for us, but I am grateful for the ways in which they affirm the angels and delineate a proper understanding of them.Practically speaking, the presence of angels reminds us of the world beyond that which we apprehend with our senses. I think this a great book for sorting out what place angels should have in our theology.Thank you to Thomas Nelson for providing me a copy of this book (via Book sneeze) in exchange for this review.",5.0,Help!

Incredibly, it is still just about the only device designed to surf the web on tv. The Revue allows me to go to sites I wouldn't go to with a pc for fear of spam, viruses, and malware. I go to sites that allow me to watch basically anything that's on any network as I got rid of cable over a year ago. I watched season 4 of Breaking Bad on one of these sites, and am now watching Boardwalk Empire. I also watch espn3 on it, and although the quality of the stream varies, it's usually better during the day, it's better than watching on a pc. It does get buggy sometimes, won't load video, shockwave flash crashes, says can't display content, etc. I then have to unplug it for a minute and it usually solves the problem. Tonight video wouldn't load for Mets-Yankees game, unplugged for a minute and it was fine thereafter. It even allows me to listen to grooveshark music, but not mog or rdio, which is strange.

Georgie (after his older brother's abdication many years later) is to become George VI, and Johnnie, afflicted with epilepsy, is shunted away from public view as well as the company of his family, where he grows up under the care of a devoted retinue, then dies at the age of 14.Poliakoff's scripting and direction make this story fragmented and starkly cool, representing life in the royal family's many residences as claustrophobic and its members as emotionally distant from each other. Georgie is the winning center of warmth and intelligence in the film, befriending a close aid of the king's (played wonderfully by Bill Nighy) and regarding his young brother with unwavering affection. Also at the center of the film is Johnnie's devoted caretaker (Gina McKee) who struggles unfailingly to find room for him in his parents' hearts.Meanwhile, events in Europe have their inevitable impact as both king and queen succumb to the dark forces that seem ready to sweep across war-time Britain. And their cousins, the Emperor of Russia and his family, are assassinated while Britain hesitates to offer them refuge from the Bolshevik Revolution.A powerful film, without many moments of emotional release.

A1R7CX1I1WYIKY,B000VSKAI8,Amazon Customer,"[9, 9]","After spending several hundred dollars at the chiropractor's office to relieve my pinched nerve and arthritic lower back I decided to look for an inversion table.  The overall reviews led me to picking this Ironman 4000 over the Teeter inversion models and I'm very happy I did.  The Teeter models have a problem with the ankle restraints being painful and requiring an additional purchase for relief.  I stepped right on this and had no ankle pain to deal with.FIRST THE NEGATIVES.1. This sucker is heavy.  Take a friend, a dolly, or expect to drag it (as I did) should you have to pick it up.2. One of the reviews warned about the foam material it is packed with.  It is very crumbly and will get all over if you don't contain it.  Most of this problem I eliminated by picking up all the pieces and putting them in trashbags before I began assembly.3. Once assembled, the table isn't something you could use and fold up for storage once or twice a day.  Make sure you have room for it.NOW THE POSITIVES.1. As intimidating as it looked to assemble everything went together perfectly.  There was no problem identifying parts or trying to line up holes to make it go together.  The tools provided were adequate but you probably have better tools of your own.2. This bench is extremely well constructed and designed.  In today's buyer beware world I believe I have spent money wisely and expect to use this the rest of my life.3. The Ironman 4000 is very heavy and stable.  I have no worries that anyone within the 300 pound, 6 foot 5 inch limits could use this and be safe.4. This isn't a miracle cure.  But if you want to stretch your spine, keep your flexibility, and even strengthen your abdominal muscles over a period of time, a few minutes a day on this machine should help your goals.This isn't a toy for your grandkids to do gymnastics on.

It was a sickening feeling that still churns my stomach. As the spanking was going on, I tried my hardest to not cry or scream or even whimper because I knew that I would get another set of beatings if I did this.

I have not yet been able to put my computer on it because my back is so sore after fighting with it all day.If you see a review that says this is ""easy"" to put together do NOT believe them!The nightmare assembly begins with none of the pieces being labelled.  That means you have to use trial an error to try to figure out what is what.  The only pieces that can be identified by logic are the small hanging shelf below the drawer, the table top, and the drawer side pieces.  Nothing else is clear until you play with it a few times.  it is not even clear which sides are the ""right"" verses ""wrong"" sides, let alone front from back and left from right.It was not until I was ready to put on the top metal bracket for the top shelf that I realized I had assembled parts of this backwards!Since the screws are not grouped and labelled, I managed to put the screws for the upper section into the drawer -- which was not obvious until I was ready for that section and my remaining screws would not fit.  Some of these parts are very similar in size so it is easy to confuse what is what, especially with the poor quality diagram on the ""instructions"" and micro type face used on the page.The only way I eventually assembled the desk was by coming back to Amazon and looking time and time again at the finished photo.  That is the ONLY way to really get it done.I should add that I am very good at furniture kits and have a lot of experience putting them together.  So it's pretty clear to me that the problem with assembly is really the lack of labeling and actual instructions.  In fact, you might do better to ditch the instructions and figure it out yourself; they are that useless.I am hoping once my computer is on the cart it will be a good piece of furniture.  Others think so and I bought this based on posted reviews.But ""easy"" to put together -- do not believe it!  this is the hardest kit I have ever attempted.  My entire body hurts from doing this.Also, because of the wierd ways the pieces go together, you cannot do this very well from a regular room or on the floor.  you need saw horses and other DYI tools and aids to help you balance clunky pieces.

A2MTUEA9UNCN50,1118608577,Alicia Webb,"[0, 0]","Chris Hadnagy's role as a distinguished figure in the Cybersecurity community is delightfully apparent in his authorship of ""Unmasking the Social Engineer"". In this second book on the art of social engineering (his topic of specialty), Hadnagy expertly analyzes Dr. Paul Ekman's lifelong work on body language. He deciphers and explains information about the various types on non-verbal communication while revealing relatable scenarios that are highly applicable to the social engineering element of cybersecurity.This book may trigger many 'ah ha' moments, especially if you are new to studying the art of body language. You will suddenly understand in far greater depth why people do the things they do with their body. You will also gain heightened awareness of how you control your own body, and how your body language might be perceived by others.As a cherry on top of it all, the book even contains a medley of helpful, illustrative photographs to help visually relay concepts in the study of body language.Similar to the concept of ethical hacking, one must learn to think like a hacker (or social engineer in this case) in order to most effectively defend against a social engineer. For example, in Chapter 7- The Human Emotional Processor, Hadnagy discusses the importance of building empathy or sadness during the process of an Amygdala hijack. He gives details of what a person might do or say in order to gain that empathy. After reading these details and letting it all sink in, the reader somehow instantly become a little less vulnerable to this sort of attack. This book is a solid proof that knowledge is power, especially in the study of nonverbal communication.I have had the personal pleasure of interviewing Chris Hadnagy two times in the past two years and have gained a world of insight into the art of social engineering by doing so.

AODKUG6FAKD2Z,1564784363,"Bryan Byrd ""reviewer of bad films and good books""","[6, 6]","In 'Knowledge of Hell', a narrator who shares the name and biography of author Ant&oacute;nio Lobo Antunes leaves the vacation town of Quinta da Balaia and drives through the Portuguese countryside toward Lisbon, to return to his duties as a psychiatrist at Miguel Bombarda mental hospital.  Along the way, the author strives to peel away the faade of his character, to report his scattered thoughts, memories, fantasies and fears concerning his work, while describing the surrounding countryside in terms both nightmarish and threatening.  Though this character, like Antunes, was also involved in the cruel Portuguese Colonial War in Angola, and knew up-close the barbaric realities of conflict, it wasn't until his tenure began at Miguel Bombarda that he truly gained a knowledge of Hell.This was my first experience with Antunes' work, and, stylistically, it is the most difficult prose I've ever read.  Here the author switches points of view abruptly - sometimes mid-sentence - and inserts dreams and fantasies into the narrative without alerting the reader in any way.  He projects his paranoia and insecurities onto partial memories, desires, and absurd imaginary confrontations.  Sometimes he records dream-like episodes, where he is suddenly mistaken for a patient and locked away in the asylum, or he inhabits the unknowable final conversations of a suicide, but presents them all in the same unreal tempo as those thoughts that I had credited as rational.  To further complicate, he piles simile on top of simile, modifying one with another, and perhaps even another, as the sentence winds through clause after clause until I'm forced to go back and hunt for the original subject.  In the end, it is a non-linear phantasmagoria where Angola, the hospital, and Portugal, as represented by its countryside and history, all collapse into the refractory, unreliable mental process of this doctor and splatter across the page with abandon.It took more than a chapter to even accustom myself to the rhythms of Antunes' words, and even though I was eventually able to penetrate the style for its content, I would never say that the book flowed or became easier to comprehend.  It did remain consistent to itself though, but only by maintaining an aggressive concentration was I able to see the book through.  After finishing, I went back over the first chapter, and was quite surprised to see just how much more I was able to glean from it; so there is no doubt that, for me, should I ever decide to re-read the book, that I'll pick up a substantial amount of new information.But it does not take a great deal of discernment to understand that Antunes is condemning the field of psychiatry here - that, literally, the inmates are running the asylum, that psychiatry is nothing more than an advanced form of charlatanism, and that the system of the institution is ineffective, cruel, and broken.  It is the weight of the inhumanity that Antunes' alter ego in the book has experienced in that institution that has nearly fractured his own mental processes, and thus sparked a vacation, a sabbatical away from the hospital to which he is in the process of returning.So what is it exactly that Antunes is trying to accomplish with his complicated prose if his objectives are this straightforward? (As an aside, I will freely admit the possibility that there are uncounted concealed insights that I was unable to pick up on.  Yet I can't help feeling that any insights I may have missed circle back to the original proposition that no one is crazier than anyone else, no matter what their exterior behavior indicates, and that modern attempts to deal with mental illness is even more barbaric than warfare.)  About mid-way through the book, it dawned on me that if anyone were able to fully and thoroughly document the mental processes and thoughts going on in my own head at any given time, the result would also look like a tangled, incoherent mess.  Like Antunes' habit of skipping helter-skelter from subject to memory to observation to fantasy, my own thoughts often follow similar, incomprehensible patterns, even including the disassociation technique of thinking of myself in the third-person.  Of course, since I'm comfortable there, my craziness seems normal, though to anyone else it would sound certifiable.And that may be the point Antunes' is most eager to elicit with his oblique styling.  Yet since other reviewers and editorials concerning his work indicate that his technique is consistent throughout his oeuvre, then I must assume that, rather than a limited objective meant to merely enhance the points of this particular book, his methods are an exhaustive and detailed attempt to honestly describe the reality of our mental world by portraying it as it actually functions.  Thus, the difference between Antunes (at least here in 'Knowledge of Hell') and those writers trying to reveal the subconscious or detailing hallucinogenic states or even those writers like Faulkner, whose dense dreamy prose seems designed to awaken us to an idea, is that Antunes is a writer concerned with realism - with an absolute commitment to faithfully reproduce his character's interior dialogue.  His technique then is a way to illuminate that reality, like a cubist painter who tries to reveal three dimensions on a flat canvas.  To someone with little patience for such things, neither attempt is going to come off very well.After absorbing the novelty of this idea, I have to admit that I slowly began losing the edge of my interest.  Rooting around in the muck of anyone's consciousness is bound to be distasteful at best, though 'Knowledge of Hell' does not fully plumb the depths of sordidness that I often suspected it was leading me toward.  Still, it is called 'Knowledge of Hell' for a reason, and though I think Antunes legitimately discussed unpalatable subjects without exploiting them purely for emotional response, this is not a book for the squeamish.'Knowledge of Hell' was originally published in 1980, one year after the book ""The Land at the End of the World', and, by inference, might be considered as sort of a sequel - or at least a continuation of the story that began in Angola and then picks up in the Miguel Bombarda hospital.  I do still plan on reading 'The Land at the End of the World' at some time - perhaps that is indicative of the value I found in 'Knowledge of Hell' - but my enthusiasm is tempered by the emotional drag of this first acquaintance.  The overall effect is one of a severely subjective appraisal of the world in which ignorance is truly bliss, and once those who are discerning enough pierce the veil of our mutually agreed upon reality, there is little beyond it but despair and loneliness.On a lighter note, I found this Dalkey Archive Press edition first-rate and solid, and the partial listing of their catalog full of fascinating unknowns (to me).  Based on their recognition and inclusion of Antonio Lobo Antunes in their stable of writers, and the quality of their books, this looks as if their list might be worth investigating regardless of what I know about the individual authors, much the same way I'll often take a flyer on unknown authors from the NYRB imprint.

Here are some added reasons why:Some of the mothership and fighter effects are adequate to good.  Most are poor.  The beam weapons are, IMHO, very poor.  The Sheriff's step van crash was such a poor effect, they had to edit out most of it and make the footage just the briefest glimpse.Like many not so good films, much of it is depicted at night allowing the old crutch; poor to no lighting.  Frequently almost a totally dark screen.  Many or most times, it appears the audience is expected to just use their imagination since not enough light is present to see who is who, details, actions, etc.Additionally, the background music is extremely tedious.  One plus regarding sound:  At least the film maker didn't choose to try to ""enhance"" this poor film with deafening, ear bleeding sound effects.  Likewise, the director did NOT resort to having the cameraman shake the camera to add fake action to a dying film.  I kept expecting it somehow.Probably not what they intended, but the actors and actresses are frequently directed to give a ridiculous slack jawed look of surprise.  These phony expressions are so far gone, they are actually funny.Strong suggestion:  Don't pay any added money to rent or buy the movie download or the DVD.

A1HMV248RPGTIM,0393341372,LEON L CZIKOWSKY,"[3, 3]","The author seeks hope for people with severe mental illnesses and their families.  He is troubled that the deinstitutionalization of people with such illnesses such as severe schizophrenia has led to much violence.  He has found over 3,000 cases where a person with paranoid schizophrenia has committed murder.People became aware of deplorable conditions in mental hospitals with particular intensity in the 1940s and following decades.  This led to patients being removed from mental hospitals. In 1955, there were 558,000 in public mental hospitals (when the national population was 164 million).  In 2006, there were 40,000 in public mental hospitals (with a national population of 300 million).  Many of those who were deinstitutionalized found themselves as victims of violence, were incarcerated, and/or became homeless.The legal movement to close or reduce mental hospitals argued that involuntary hospitalizations were contrary to our belief in freedom.The National Mental Health Information Center estimates there are 12.8 million adult (or 5.4% of adults) with a serious mental illness. 4.7 million receive social security for their non-retardation disorder.  It is within this group that exists a subset that creates most of the problems.  England estimates that 10% of its schizophrenics created 80% of totally costs associated with schizophrenia.The author estimates there are 500,000 ""problematic"" and 50,000 ""most dangerous"" people with severe mental problems.  They live primarily in urban areas.  The crimes that often shock the public the most are often committed by people in this group.The author notes the question facing us is whether or not crazy people ""have a right to be crazy"".Guidelines state a person cannot be hospitalized against the person's will until they are a threat to themselves or to someone else.  Many families live in fear of a threatening relative, often claiming voices or God is commanding them to commit violent acts.  Yet until a violent act is attempted or occurs, outside help is not available.  Unfortunately, many people have been murdered or harmed before the help is provided.  Conversely, people whose illnesses caused them to threaten others have been killed or injured by those they threatened.In the 1950s, some conservative political groups believed that mental health treatment was part of Communist-Soviet attempts to control the minds of Americans.  Minute Women, U.S.A, compared mental health hospitalizations to the Soviet concentration camps.  The Daughters of American Revolution noted that 80% of U.S. psychologists were from foreign countries, with many of them from the Soviet Union.  Fiscal conservatives wanted to reduce mental health spending.Medicaid and Medicare passed in 1965, providing for benefits for people with mental disabilities.  State governments switched patients from state supported mental hospitals to community settings where the Federal government would pay for the costs of care through Medicaid and Medicare.Liberals criticized the warehousing of people with mental disabilities in psychiatric hospitals where they were provided with inadequate care.California responded by passing the Lanterman-Petris-Short Act that diminished mental health treatment in 1969.  The bill passed the legislature unanimously.  Supporters of the legislation believed the patients with psychiatric difficulties were able to make their own decisions as to what treatment they wanted.  It was argued that people with mental health disabilities had lower rates of violent acts than did the general population.  It was not noted that the reason for this lower rate was because many were in institutions where they could not commit violent public acts.Once California closed psychiatric hospitals, it then faced the problem that it lacked facilities to treat people who sought treatment or met the legal requirements for involuntary treatment.In 1973, California began closing many psychiatric hospitals.  Governor Ronald Reagan were not impressed that 71% of psychiatrists voted Democratic nor that several psychiatrists had stated that Reagan ally Barry Goldwater was not sane.California had 37,000 psychiatric patients institutionalized in the mid-1950s.  The deinstitutionalization of patients began under Governor Goodwin Knight, a Republican, and continued under successive Governors Edmund Brown, a Democrat, and Reagan, a Republican.  By 1973, there were under 7,000 people institutionalized as psychiatric patients during Reagan's tenure.The number of patient s involuntarily institutionalized by court order decreased by 99% in California from 1969 to 1978.  The average days of hospitalization for those who were involuntarily committed fell from 180 days to 15 days.Many of those discharged from psychiatric care became homeless.  Many lived in boarding houses in condition worse than they had when institutionalized.  Three studies concluded those discharged lived in ghetto conditions.  Many had not access to psychiatric treatment.  Many eventually entered the criminal justice system.A 1971 study of the Los Angeles homeless estimated that 30% to 50% had serious mental illness.  They were often victimized with beatings, getting robbed, and being raped.  Later studies confirmed similar results, with one study finding 79% of the homeless surveyed had at some point been in a psychiatric hospital and 74% had been arrested.  This study also found 30% were found to be ""too paranoid"" to accept psychiatric help.Psychiatric services in San Francisco County increased 99% between 1980 and 1993.  Sacramento County jails reported having, in 1995, 28% of its inmates requiring psychiatric medication.  The author notes that prisons had become the largest mental health institutions.Prison presents problems for mentally ill prisoners.  Violent inmates are sometimes put off by the behavior of the mentally ill and inmates then attack the mentally ill.No Federal or state government is producing data on the number of violent crimes committed by those with severe mental illness.  It is known there are many instances where this happens.  It is also observed that an increase in managed care and outpatient services seems to lower these rates.In 1955, California had 37,500 state hospital beds, or 1 for every 352 of the state's 13.2 million.  In 2003, there were 4,275 such beds, or 1 for every 8,304 of the state's 35.5 million.A 2008 San Diego study found that homelessness was the reality for 20% of patients treated for schizophrenia and for 17% of patients treated for bipolar disorder.A 1999 California study found 20% of state prisoners and 11% of county inmates were severely mentally ill.Every California county has more people with severe mental illness in prison than in a hospital.The cost of California prison psychiatric treatments was $21 million in 1993 and $245 million in 2003.Some opinions have changed over time.  Frank Lanterman, the legislator who sponsored the Lanterman-Petris-Short Act, argues the Act needs to be changed.  Ironically, a day before holding  a hearing on allowing court ordered outpatient treatment for dangerous people who refuse to take the medicine for their disorders, a psychotic person drove his 18 wheel tractor into the side of the California Capitol building.  The proposal passed and became law.Fiscal conservatives fought a movement towards providing more psychiatric services. The costs, in Los Angeles in 2004, for one day of psychiatric hospital care was $607, for prison was $85, for jail was $64, and for a public shelter was $3.  The author notes this failed to consider cost of the numerous criminal justices arrests of people with psychiatric problems.It is estimated that people with severe mental illness committed at least 4,700 homicides between 1970 and 2004 in California.In 1972, a three judge panel in the Lessard Decision created specific criteria that made it more difficult to involuntarily treat someone for a mental illness. This overturned 700 years of civil law going back to England that a government is responsible for protecting people who can't protect themselves.There is a risk that government may have civil suits for failing to provide proper mental illness care.  A Federal judge awarded $5.4 million in such a suit in 1999.Dane County Wisconsin has a team of 5 to 15 mental health professionals who take round the clock responsibility for mental health patients.  They provide care including medication maintenance, housing, job training, and rehabilitation.It was found in a study that 57% of schizophrenic patients studied were not aware they had schizophrenia to a ""moderate to severe"" degree.  In these cases, the brain often has anosognosia, which means the person in unable to recognize it has a disorder.  With Alzheimer's patients, anosognosia is a permanent condition.  Anosognosia in schizophrenics exists in the frontal lobes, the parietal lobes, and connections between these two lobes.  Anosognosia thus affects multiple brain areas.  Anosognosia is the primary reason why someone with mental illness does not take their medication for their mental illness.  When the law requires a person to request treatment in order to receive treatment, a person with anosognosia will not be treated.  Sadly, anosognosia is linked to increased violent behavior.After the Lesard decision, every state by 1980 had adopted laws restricting the involuntary institutionalization of the mentally ill.A New York study found that mentally ill homeless who were supposed to be but were not taking their medications were 40 times more likely to commit a violent crime and 27 times more likely to commit a non-violent crime than were mentally ill people requiring medication who were in stable housing environments.Studies indicate that at least 5% to 10% of people with severe psychiatric illness will engage in at least one serious act of violence per year.It is conservatively estimated that people with severe mental illness commit at least 5% of murders.  About 50% to 60% of murders committed by a mentally ill person are of a family members.  By contrast, a family member is killed in 16% of murders committed by someone without a mental illness.The violent behavior of a minority of people with mental illness has created a stigma for all people with mental illness.People with epilepsy are required to make medication before operating vehicles.  The author notes further laws requiring the taking of medication by people with additional mental health issues may be required.A New York study found that 40%of mentally ill patients discharged from hospitalization are re-hospitalized within six months. An Illinois study found 30% of mental health patients discharged are re-hospitalized within one month.A study showed that mental illness patients who likely were taking their medication were 3% more violent than others in a 10 week period compared to those who were not likely taking their medication who were 14% more likely to commit violence.  This study concluded that mentally ill people were not significantly more likely to commit violence than their neighbors.  The author notes those with a anosgosia were not included in this study, which skewed the sample. This study also compared rates of crime within the high crime rate neighborhoods were mentally ill people tend to live.The author supports a law that broadens the scope of requiring involuntarily treatment.  Assisted Outpatient Treatments laws have passed several states to allow for the involuntary treatment of seriously mentally ill people who pose a danger.  These treatments are given to people with past experiences with violence, are substance abusers, have anosognosia, are refusing to properly take their medications, are displaying antisocial behaviors, and have a neurological impairment.  It is noted that 85% to 90% of people in this category are male.A hospital uses criteria to know when to have extra security on hand.  Using similar criteria as descried previously reduced violent acts in one hospital study by 92%.The author recommends developing a data base of high risk people by judicial order.  This would be available only to law enforcement officers, authorized mental health personnel, and to a limited degree to firearm dealers who would not be allowed to sell a firearm to a name that checks against this list.There are numerous ways to move people towards treatment.  Those charged with misdemeanors could be provided the option of taking their medications versus imprisonment. The author also mentions that government benefits could be withdrawn to those not taking their medication.State governments are urged to collect more data.

Beyond the fence near his house, he sees people, but is confused by their strange striped pajamas and their sad demeanor.Bruno's loneliness is somewhat relieved when he becomes friends with a boy on the other side of the fence. They meet daily and exchange comments about their daily lives, but neither fully understands the circumstances of the other.Boyne presents a story about the Holocaust like none other before. He brings tragedy to life through the eyes of innocent children. Readers of all ages will be spellbound until the last page and beyond.Reviewed by:  Sally Kruger, aka ""Readingjunky""",5.0,Courtesy of Teens Read Too,1163721600.0,"11 17, 2006"

To my utter happiness a fantastic character showed up--Lieutenant Jack Daniels--and I just couldn't stop reading.  Thank god it was only a novella.The serial killers--yes, there are two, and it's kinda like a first date of sorts--were sick as hell, yet unnervingly interesting.  And I was horrified to find my new favorite female police officer at their tender mercies...but I was suddenly ravenous to find out how she out-witted and dispatched these two sicko's.I can't say I want to read anymore about the two serial killers, though I read there are more stories about them, but I am definitely going to pick up another Jack Daniels novel to get lost in.",5.0,"A very, very good read.",1334275200.0,"04 13, 2012"

I'm a dedicated air gunner and have either tried most other A/G pistols or owned them, I'm a older guy. Only the Crosman 1377c pneumatic in .177 (now also in.22) which I also own, can compare for value or ownership. I have a ""Patio Range"" and shoot at 10m from a bench rest with sand bags with accuracy my priority, the 2240 delivers for me quarter size groups with a BSA red/dot shooting Crosman H/P's,7.9 gr. I'm satisfied with that,and I can get them at Walmart cheap. a scope would tighten up the group. I also get 50+ shots per cylinder. The one downside to this pistol is that its slow, no action shooting here. I've modified mine with a Crosman steel breech and Crosman cut down 12"" barrel, the after market accessories seem to be endless for this gun. The stock rear sight is funky but works just fine in standard trim. I even like the grips, these guns are very easy pistols to work on, think kitchen table. The Co2 starts losing power below 60 dg F, so its a warm weather gun. My gun holds Co2 very well, (months) I really have no complaints, be sure you add a drop of pellgun oil to the tip of the Co2 cylinder and the 2240 will last a very long time, mine is 7 yrs. old and still going strong. Every part has a number and stock parts are dirt cheap if ever needed. I'll probably buy another one and leave it stock so I can use a holster for my woods ""walk around"" gun. My gun hits very hard, it will blow thru starlings at my bird feeder range (30') and its not to noisy, it saves money from traveling to and from firearm ranges. I find the cost of shooting this pistol about the same as a .22 rim-fire (bulk) when everything is considered, pellets & Co2. My home range has much better amenities than ANY firearm range, and I get to shoot in my own back yard, whats not to like?.  this pistol is made in the USA, and I highly recommend it.

They made the effect supplement to the activities I designed for each brain rule.I appreciate that the author only includes solid, and repeated, research in his book.

They actually has just received them in my area, and IMMEDIATELY discounted the base unit and ALL THE ATTACHMENTS. So naturally I picked it up. Just to be clear, I own a mainly Dewalt power tools. I already have a Dewalt 18v XRP hammer drill, two Dewalt 18v XRP drills, a Dewalt 18V flashlight, a Dewalt 18v XRP impact driver, as well as a Dewalt 10 amp corded drill, a Dewalt corded random orbital sander, and a Dewalt corded circular saw, a Dremel SawMax, a Dewalt corded jigsaw, a Sonicrafter oscillating tool, an MK Diamond 5&#34; handheld tile saw, not to mention an 11 amp and a 12 amp Milwaukee Sawzall. So I don't NEED another drill, or impact driver. But the novelty of the interchangeable heads appealed to me.SO... I picked up the base unit, and the attachments the big box Home something store was selling *the impact driver, detail sander, trim saw, jigsaw, and the oscillating tool attachment. I then headed over to the other big box store and picked up the router attachment, and the 20v Li-Ion leaf blower/weed whacker combo set on sale, it comes with a quick charger better than the one with the base Matrix, and TWO more batteries for the price of TWO BATTERIES! Essentially the blower and weed whacker and charger were free. THEN I headed over to Sears, where they sell the competitive Bolt-On version. The clerk told me it wasn't compatible, but I came prepared with the impact driver and a charged battery. I popped the battery in their display model, and the impact driver head on and voila! It worked just peachy. The Craftsman version had a hammer drill attachment and an air inflation tool, so naturally I picked those up as well as their bag. Then I went back and grabbed the reciprocating saw attachment when it came out.Bottom line... Do I NEED these tools? No. I have every one of them in another form. But I like having a cordless interchangeable option. My Dewalt 18V impact driver blows this Matrix 20V Lithuim Ion out of the water. But for 95% of what it gets used for it's fine. I even reach for it more often now. These tools aren't perfect. They are, however, a hell of a lot cheaper than buying each of these tools as a stand alone version from one of the higher end manufacturers like Dewalt, Bosch, Milwaukee, or Makita.So if you're just doing so home improvement projects here and there I would definitely say get these.

While they do like board games, we actually rarely finish one because they move onto something else or just want to move around.  Elefun Snackin' Safari is a super fun game to get kids moving.  It is a game for kids ages 3 and up, and I genuinely feel a 3 year  old could play it and understand it.  All you have to do is snap down your elephant trunk and have it suction-cup to a card.  We had no problems with the cards sticking and my boys had a blast.  The length was perfect and they were able to comfortably hold the elephant in their hands, as was I.  The game is for two players only, which may be a drawback if you have more than two kids, but it goes pretty quick as there are only 13 snack cards to snack up!

The belt is made of sturdy sections of leather held together by two tiny, thin and weak connectors.

I repaired it with leather adhesive under the connectors, and reinforced the other connectors with the adhesive as well.  However, most people don't have a home workshop like mine that would have things like that available.

A2Q6C03WBWO14G,0898756138,Beck,"[14, 17]","I could choose from a few different angles to take with my review. I could just write about my own personal opinion about the book, and tell you to take that at face value, or I could write to convince you why my opinion is justified, in the hopes of saving you money from buying this book. Kim Jong-Il, however, has already done much of the work for me, when he wrote his preface to the book (find it in the product description). I'll repeat it here, as I think it offers more than enough insight to what the book is like:""The cinema is now one of the main objects on which efforts should be concentrated in order to conduct the revolution in art and literature. The cinema occupies an important place in the overall development of art and literature. As such it is a powerful ideological weapon for the revolution and construction. Therefore, concentrating efforts on the cinema, making breakthroughs and following up success in all areas of art and literature is the basic principle that we must adhere to in revolutionizing art and literature.""Allow me to break this down sentence by sentence. His first statement is rather bold (regarding cinema as a forefront of art and literature), yet he offers nothing to back up this claim (I know, it's just the preface, but you wont find any justifications in the book either.). Moreover, why would such a revolution be necessary, wanted, or even interesting to read for that matter? As has been previously noted, repetition can be found throughout (e.g. the preface's first 2 sentences: ""The cinema... art and literature."", ""the cinema"" and ""revolution"" are repeated 3 times in 4 sentences, ""art and literature"" repeated 4 times, twice in the last sentence.). All 4 sentences of this preface say roughly the same thing: Cinema, being an important part in art and literature, can be a useful tool in revolutionizing the whole. I hope that's enough.I can imagine only one reason to read this book: to see (if only a minor amount) into the mind of a person in a position of great influence. Let me say, it is my own opinion, that you'll get the jist of the book just from reading the preface a couple times.",1.0,As good of an author as he is a leader.,1282089600.0,"08 18, 2010"

On the island, you don't have to worry about the neighbors' dogs chasing you, or that shady looking guy standing up on the next corner. You don't have to worry if it's late at night, or early morning. You don't have to worry about it raining or storming on you, or dying of a heat stroke in the sun either!! =]I like the trainers; they encourage me to keep playing every day; I like to hear what kinds of things they come up with to say. I mainly use Warren as my Trainer. He flirts with me, and that amuses me, LOL!!You can use the Wii remote and nunchuck, the Wii balance board, or the DDR mat with this game. I use the Wii Balance Board. You step to the beat of the songs. Everytime you hit the beat, you get points; use those points to buy trees, buildings, new songs, open up new routes, and more! (when you use the nunchuck & remote, you put the nunchuck in your pocket like a pedometer).You can change the difficulty level to make it easier, which I reccommend for beginners.You can add things to your queue (the 3 cirlcles at the top, middle of the screen), and then when you have enough points, you get the item. For example, let's say you want to buy a tree for 50 points, but you only have 10 points. You click on the capsule anyway, and it adds it to your queue. Once you get 50 points, the item automatically is purchased. But now, you have to walk back and find the capsule again, and this time it will be glowing, so you'll know that you've already bought it. Click it, and VOILA - there's your tree!CONS:I don't care much for the mini games included, but I haven't really given them much of a chance.Some of the songs are crap, but there are enough songs that I like to keep me satisfied.You walk past the same character over and over again throughout the game.

And they really do rock the house here.  Listen to Dennis ""The Little Drummer Boy"" Diken ""bash away, bash away all"" during the intro to the Smithereens' own version of ""Rockin' Around The Christmas Tree"" while Jim Babjak's electric guitar decks the halls with reens riffs, Severo's bass pumps along at full ""thrilla throttle"" and Pat DiNizio croons in maximum rock `n' carolling mode.  This is obviously not your average piped-in holiday music at the mall snoozefest.There is much to enjoy on this Christmas album beginning with its majestic opener ""Waking Up On Christmas Morning"" written by lead guitarist Jim Babjak.  It is one of three Smithereens originals on this CD that also includes ""Christmas (I Remember)"" and a rerecording of their song ""All Revved Up"" that's been re-revved up and revamped as ""Christmas Time All Over The World"".  The Smithereens also add their own holiday dressing to some Christmas classics and semi-rare covers.  Pat contributes some exuberant harmonica playing to Elvis' ""Santa Bring My Baby Back (To Me)"" while the guitars chug along like a runaway ""Polar Express"" train.  The Smithereens also surf the yule tide with an excellent cover of the Beach Boys' ""Merry Christmas, Baby"" and do a really rollicking version of Chuck Berry's ""Run Rudolph Run"".  The album later takes a side trip to Who-ville when Jim Babjak sings ""Christmas"" from the Who's ""Tommy"" album ""and you know that can't be bad"" when the Smithereens joyously revisit fab four territory with the Beatles' ""Christmas Time Is Here Again"".  They even salute the Ramones with a catchy punk vs. Motown re-arrangement of their holiday song ""Merry Christmas (I Don't Want To Fight Tonight)"".  The band also rocks in the New Year with their Christmas carolers on steroids version of ""Auld Lang Syne"".""Christmas with the Smithereens"" delivers a much needed kick in the Christmas balls to an often tired and tiresome holiday music industry.  It's the perfect antidote to overly treacly Christmas ""pap music"" and sugar shock inducing holiday elevator music.

PRISCO,"[0, 1]","It's nice to see Peter Banks getting some recognition now, which about as well-deserved as the lack of it he had previously.A big part of the this album's appeal rests with the staggeringly star-studded support, though  it is somewhat thinly spread: John Wetton, for example, is credited only for one short track mid-album. Phil Collins has never been particularly outstanding as a drummer. Steve Hackett plays through most of this, making this something of a Yes-meets-Genesis album. Like both those bands, there's a rather labored quality to the compositions (which form what was side 1 of the LP).In contrast, there's an agreeably informal quality to the concluding jams that feature fellow guitarist Jan Akkerman, with whom Peter enjoys energetic repartee. These were previously side two of the LP -- arguably worth the price in themselves, for fans of long, spontaneous jamming between kings.Consequently, we find an album possessed of interesting aspects, not too heavily weighted toward friendly improvisation nor strict composition: songs and probing jams in equal measure, truly ""two sides"" of Peter Banks.

Rather than portraying the Philippines as the proud emerging market that it has become and the role that the US has played in that remarkable story, the author states that the Filipino people are largely dishonest and that an entire generation of women between the ages of 18 to 24 are prostitutes.There can simply be no excuse for such writings. Thousands of the women who he wrongfully claims are working on their backs are actually working in call centers throughout the country.  The Philippines is the number one outsourcing destination in the world and it has surpassed India as the number one location for call center work.

Koenigsberg,"[6, 8]","Funny how tastes differ.I do love everything by Xenakis, but .... when I listen to this CD, ""Kassandra"" is my favorite.Sometimes I even find myself skipping through the other pieces, and only listening to ""Kassandra"" in its entirety.But ""Kassandra"" never fails, to thrill and chill me. It is one of my most favorite of Xenakis' pieces (and I'm a big fan, I've heard a lot of his music, either live or on CD's, and I was privileged to meet him a few times, etc.).I only give this CD 4 out of 5 stars, only because I am way more fond of ""Kassandra"" than I am of the rest of it.... and the live ambient (analog) recording, though not bad, is not the absolute best audio quality I could imagine; though that is partially due to the ridiculously extreme dynamic range that had to be captured, in the performance of the pieces, from the loud loud percussion down to much quieter sounds.I would say that ""Kassandra"" is one of my favorite Xenakis pieces (and being a big Xenakis fan, that is saying a lot), but the instrumentals on the rest of the CD sometimes grow tiresome to me (it's still Xenakis, so it's still great, just not among my favorite pieces of his).If you do love the extended vocal style of ""Cassandra"" as I do (a deep male baritone voice, often desperate, often wildly gyrating between deep tones and shrieking falsetto), you will also probably like Xenakis' piece ""Ais"", also for a male voice, which has been recorded several times on some of his other CD's. I think ""Ais"", like ""Cassandra"", is also another addition to his Oresteia family of pieces? (also the voice in ""Ais"" is amplified unlike that in ""Kassandra"", and I think ""Ais"" is for a tenor, rather than baritone?)someday I'd love to hear a new performance, of a most ""complete"" Oresteia, with ""Kassandra"", ""Ais"", and any other newer additions he made to the original suite?And yet another vocal piece of his that I really love, in addition to ""Kassandra"" and ""Ais"", is one called ""N'Shima"" (for ""amplified peasant voices""), also recorded more than once I think.plus to round out the mentioning of Xenakis' vocal pieces, there are a couple more choral works, on a CD shared with some of Messiaen's choral pieces.",4.0,"actually I prefer ""Kassandra""",1134432000.0,"12 13, 2005"

If you are equally tired of listening to tenured publicly overpaid diversity professors  drone on about the percecution / profiling of muslim men, also sick of socio-communist ""journalists"" living, writing, and enriching themselves in the land of the free, only to deride Uncle Sam every chance they get. Then buy this book, unlike much of what the leftist media write about, Goldberg's essays are filled with truth and fact instead of the outright lies and imaginary conservative demons liberals seem to be so fond of taking pen to. Thank You Mr. Goldberg.... p.s. One problem, by making him number 37, you have assigned way to much importance to Al Franken's role in the current media shootout, Mr. Franken has lent just about about the same amount of talent to the liberal media's cause as he did to SNL way back when real comedy writers like Dan Akyroyd, Michael O'Donahue and Gilda Radner had us rolling on the floor in convulsions. Franken was and is still, only riding the coat tails of people largely more talented than himself. You got your 15 minutes Al, its time to cut your losses, call it a day and give someone with real talent a chance at some air time....",5.0,Goldberg's Golden Hammer,1123891200.0,"08 13, 2005"

These clusters are so small that you couldn't even call them that if this was cereal.  What we've really got here is a granola cereal with bits of chocolate in it to be eaten a pinch at a time.CHOCOLATE CHUNKS: Looking at the granola through the window in the packaging you would think you could hardly taste the chocolate, like when you're eating Chips A'Hoy and somehow get a cookie that only has a couple of chips in it, but you actually taste plenty of chocolate in every bite.  It's very good, not too sweet, and very chocolatey without murdering the taste of the granola--which is also delicious.WHOLE GRAIN: There are two main reasons why whole grain is good.  First, it's more filling; one sandwich made with whole grain bread is as filling as two sandwiches on white bread for example.  You simply wont feel the need to keep stuffing yourself and that will reduce your total calorie intake by hundreds of calories per day if you have whole grain snacks like this one in addition to whole grains in your meals. The other is that whole grains range from tougher to impossible to metabolize, so your body works harder, burning more calories trying to do that (calcium does this too by the way, so it's a good idea to take a swig of milk with your whole grain snack).One added feature of whole grain is that it adds volume to your stool, so make sure to have that plunger at the ready if you're suddenly adding whole grain foods to your diet.PACKAGING: If I saw this on the shelf in the supermarket I would assume it's a cereal to put milk into or to top yogurt with.  Whomever designed the packaging and omitted the word 'snack' should be flogged.WITH MILK, EATEN WITH A SPOON: Hey, guess what, it is good as a cereal.  A half cup serving, with milk, would be about 350 to 400 calories I guess, which isn't bad for breakfast.THE F-WORD: Yes, it's got fat in it, like all granola, but since it's not in bar form, molded together with marshmallows or corn syrup you really shouldn't worry about it.  'Fat is the flavor' as the saying goes, and that warning only purtains to people who somehow think one bag of cookies should be eaten in one sitting.  Even the suggested serving size here is quite large for a snack.  Personally I found myself eating two pinches of this granola whenever I went into the kitchen to feed an urge to eat something, and that was enough to do the trick.  So don't worry about the slightly over the line fat percentage.If you're really worried about gorging yourself not only on granola, but ice cream or crackers and cheese and other delicious little goodies, don't bring the whole container with you to the living room for your several hours of nightly television.  Instead, put any snack you're going to eat in a 6oz custard cup and don't fill it more than three quarters of the way--which is about half a cup since it gets wider towards the rim.BOTTOM LINE: There really isn't any supplement that can substitute for getting your nutrients and whole grains from actual food such as granola.This is really delicious, healthy, proper snack food to get you through those periods between meals when you just want to stay satiated, keep your energy level up, and reduce any cravings you might have for something bulkier and with more calories.",4.0,"Only one star taken off for not putting the word ""snack"" on the packaging and the clusters being too small.",1243555200.0,"05 29, 2009"

A1L20MX19ZMNW5,B0014CSNDY,paisleymonsoon,"[2, 2]","The creators of this CD really got it right. Having only ever done yoga from book diagrams and descriptions, I found this venture into yoga on DVD quite refreshing. I was sort of concerned that the verbal instruction would detract from the routine or that the instructor would move from one thing to another too quickly for me to look up to follow. However, the way that the DVD is set up is that you see a video of Shiva Rea doing the yoga routine in beautiful relaxing settings such as in front of a waterfall, in the middle of a forest, or on the beach. However, she's not talking during the yoga routine. Instead, the instruction and music is all tastefully added as separate tracks. You can choose to just watch the routine, watch it with just the music, or watch it with an off-camera narrator of the various movements. I also like how the camera pans at just the right moment so that you can get a different view of Shiva Rea to make sure that you've got the pose right. Another great feature of the CD is that the different parts of the yoga routine are divided into separate chapters so that you can start wherever you would like.The poses themselves are fairly simple and basic. There's no standing on your head or doing ridiculous things that the beginner couldn't join in with. Despite the slow nature of the routines, your heart and muscles get a nice work out. There were only a few times that I found myself unable to stretch my legs out quite like she could, but I'm sure practice will get me there.The only thing I think could be a little better would be the explanation of when to inhale and when to exhale. With a very slow yoga routine, I tend to forget which one I'm supposed to be doing, so I wish the narrator would have mentioned it more often. Also, I'd hoped the DVD would contain more than one routine so that I wouldn't get bored doing the exact same thing over and over again.Overall, I found the DVD to be quite enjoyable. I'll definitely prefer it to following instructions from a book.",5.0,Tastefully Done,1210809600.0,"05 15, 2008"

So make sure you have an entire evening dedicated to reading if you pick up this book because you won't want to put it down!My Opinion:I want to start off by saying that out of all paranormal creatures zombies rank lowest on my list of favorites. I have tried repeatedly to read various zombie themed books and one after another they made it to my CNF list. (Could Not Finish) I gave After Life Lessons a chance because I am smitten with both of the authors and everything I've read from both has yet to disappoint me. That being said, After Life Lessons was the first zombie book that I actually was able to finish reading and enjoyed!I truly wasn't expecting this book to floor me like it did! This book changed my perception of the zombie genre all together. This book has a new take on the classic Zombie Apocalypse, one I find to be far more realistic to how people would respond during a zombie out-break. Most representations are filled with too much drama, cruelness, and far-out crazy antics that make the overall story hard to relate to. I find that the way the characters react in this book represents how people would really handle this type of disaster. They show the true gritty emotions; fear, love, courage, regret, and compassion. This book also has a perfect balance of zombie scenes placed throughout it. It's about so much more than just zombies, trust me.Emily and Aaron are a definite power-couple. They are like day and night, but they fit together great. Opposites really do attract, I suppose. They have so many obstacles to face but always make it through them because they have each other. They understand each other in such a profound way, if only everyone could have a chance to be in a relationship like theirs. It goes both ways, when it's going bad.. It's really damn horrible but when it's going good... It's just amazing! As a warning, when these two are alone things tend to get steamy, so make sure to keep a fan near to help with the spike in temperature.After Life Lessons put my emotions one hell of a ride that I'm not sure I'll ever recover from. It drained me physically and mentally, but I consider that to be a good thing. Any book that can have that much of an impact on me has to be special. This book has everything you could ever want in a novel... action, humor, romance, and sex. I could barely stumble out of my bed after one particular scene... oh the shock and horror I experienced. I can't share details of that scene here because it would spoil the plot. So if you're curious you will just have to read this fantastic book for yourself.

A15JJFM0OHA05Z,0140267581,Matt Burrows,"[1, 1]","Those who know and value the John Hawkes of old (Second Skin, Travesty, Blood Oranges) may be disappointed with Irish Eye. Hawkes, who once said, ""The true enemies of the novel are plot, characters, and setting,"" has forsaken his prior belief with the publishing of Irish Eye. The book itself is a mildy interesting text best representative of a nightmarish fairytale, as it surrounds readers with a unique view of Ireland and tracks the journey to maturity of young Dervla as she strives to find love and her place in the world. Along the way Hawkes treats readers to various interesting characters, of which Teddy seems the only character to represent the Hawkes of old--tortured, confined, and just angry at the world he refuses to give in and comprise. And so Dervla, our wide-eyed and innocent narrator, follows him all the way. Though some may claim Irish Eye to be a nice introduction to John Hawkes, don't let this fool you...these comments are made simply because this book is ""easier"" to read. Yes, some of Hawkes major themes are present (disorder and obscurity), but the constriction of characters and reactions/truths that arise from this are largely absent. If you're looking for an actual quality introduction to John Hawkes I would suggest Travesty or possibly Second Skin (with Second Skin being the more difficult read of the two). Overall, a major joy of Hawkes is deciphering that which he writes in order to truly understand the human condition and his fragmented, often disorganized novels challenge readers to not only reread numerous passages but ultimately come to their own conclusion of what the text tells them about life. And with this focus in mind, Irish Eye ultimately comes up short. All authors have a glitch in their library of writings and this seems to be Hawkes. An interesting read--yes.

When you have no expectations, you can never be disappointed.  So I was pleasantly surprised that MLB 2K12 has turned out to be a pretty decent game-pad baseball game.  Perhaps I'm just lucky but on my Dell Inspiron notebook it runs very smoothly with no problems at all.  Game play is very good but a lot of what you experience depends on what roster you're using and your tune file settings.I would suggest to anyone who wants a better MLB 2K12 to visit mvpmods.com  No I'm not spamming for them but they have dedicated people over there who mod baseball games to make them look and play better.  What they offer for this particular game is better than anything 2K Sports can supply.  This review is based on what I've downloaded from that site regarding roster files and difficulty tunes.Playing individual games in the Franchise Mode feature I've had many great battles, close games, blow outs.........pretty much what you would expect playing major league baseball.  Some starters go deep in the game (well over 100 pitches), extra inning nail biters, just about everything really.  Using an XBox controller for the PC seems to be the best option for this game, you don't have to re-map your button controls and you have full control over everything using this.  I would recommend this pad for this particular game if you don't already have one.I took a star off the ratings because like others have said, getting online to play someone is damned near impossible.  The new feature of this game, the MLB ""Living Season"" is also pretty much broken but like I said above, the Franchise Mode works just fine (as does one off exhibition games if that's all you want to do).  One thing though, baseball games like this will never ever replace a good sim like OOTP if you're looking for that sort of statistical gameplay only.So in closing, if you're XBox or PS3 free like I am and want to continue the tradition of PC baseball, this game is it.  Modify it the right way and you've got a pretty decent game-pad based baseball gaming experience.",4.0,Pretty good gamepad baseball,1335916800.0,"05 2, 2012"

A33DF1KSNX4SHK,1420106805,Angela Korra'ti,"[0, 1]","Scoundrel, Book 2 of Zoe Archer's Blades of the Rose series, came across my radar with a bang thanks to the Smart Bitches Trashy Books ladies and their current montly book club. As I mentioned in my review of Book 1, Warrior, I was very happy to see a cover with a hero who's not only fully dressed, but who also seemed to come right out of a mold I find most swoonable indeed: the Indiana Jones archetype, ready for adventure.Even more so that with Book 1, Scoundrel delivered this in spades. I enjoyed Scoundrel quite a bit more, in no small part due to the hero. Bennett Day of the Blades of the Rose is an unhesitant rake, cheerfully cutting a swath through the dozens of women willing to go at it with him in the sheets in between his far more serious missions for his compatriots, and sometimes both at once. Little does he know he's about to meet up with London Harcourt, the daughter of an Heir of Albion--and whose husband Bennett in fact once killed. London has no idea whatsoever of the nefarious activities of her father and spouse, and suffice to say, her worldview is blown wide open when she finds out that her father has hauled her off to Greece to make use of her gift with ancient languages. Harcourt's bent on tracking down the same Source Bennett's pursuing, and Bennett and his fellow Blades have no choice but to abduct London, clue her in, and hope like hell that she'll defect to their team and help them.A couple of things kicked Scoundrel up another notch over Book 1 for me. One is the secondary romance playing out between the witch Athena and the boat captain Kallas, which was in some ways almost more fun than the primary romance of London and Bennett--but only almost, because I had great fun with them too. I very much liked that London had refreshingly little angst about Bennett's womanizing ways, which led beautifully into Bennett flooring himself with his obligatory Realization of True Love(TM). The big revelation of said True Love in particular was quite charming; look for the ""monkeys in hats"" lines, here.I also have to give Archer props for actually making me not skim past a sex scene, for once. If an author is going to actually make me read a sex scene, she needs to have either a masterful command of the language and make me swoon on the sheer power of words alone. Or, she needs to say something interesting about the involved characters, and give me something more to go on than just the physical depiction. Archer does the latter in a goddess-play scene that I'll freely admit was, indeed, rather hot for the delightful things it said about London as a character and as a woman.Meanwhile, in the main plot, we've got ourselves a chase through Greece through lovingly described islands and waters. The Heirs are still fairly flat as villains--I still never really get a sense of any of the Heirs as actual people rather than bad guys spouting ""For the Glory of Britain!""

In the Introduction, the author writes: ""It is important to keep in mind that this is not a comprehensive Greek language course nor is it a 'Greek phrase book.' Rather, it is intended to be a very quick, very simple introduction to a few of the most basic principles of modern Greek for the student, traveler, or explorer."" This is why I give the book 4 not 5 stars. I was really looking for more of a 'phrase book' and not such a rigorous language course, even if it is a short one. There are ""key phrases"" in each lesson, and they are super useful. But the book was a little too ""serious"" for me.

A1WH1YZ5VGTKXG,1783060581,Viviane Crystal,"[1, 1]","Alesha is the classic &#8220;feral youth,&#8221; and this is her heartbreaking story.  Illiterate, unwanted by her parents, kicked out of every school she attempted to attend, and feeling totally unloved except for her best friend, J.J. who only shows love and care to his elderly grandmother, &#8220;Nan.&#8221;Alesha truly believes she has no options.  There&#8217;s a whole body of language that&#8217;s the Jamaican patois lingo of the gangs in the south end of London and the author supplies a glossary of meaning to those who haven&#8217;t a clue what life is like for these youths.  Most will never survive their young adult years; the others will wind up in jail. Their world is one of &#8220;survival of the fittest, but Alesha wonders in other words what exactly she&#8217;s fit for?This young, 15 year-old girl, earns her money by stealing clothes, delivering dope, cowering in fear to the leaders of gangs who are also at war with each other.  Several times Alesha is the victim of violence, especially when she fails to pay up after one of her drug deliveries goes bad or when she fails to acknowledge that she is owned in reality by those bigger in the criminal hierarchy of the Peckham Crew.  Her closeness to J.J. and earning &#8220;p&#8217;s&#8221; (money) is her whole world and that world is about to undergo a violent transformation.Early on in the story Alesha meets a middle-aged woman and piano teacher, Miss Merfield, who tries to show Alesha she does have options.  Depending on one&#8217;s point of view, one might feel deeply for Alesha&#8217;s attempts to change her life&#8217;s direction or one might perhaps feel quite irritated with her caustic responses in multiple scenes. For her lack of self-respect yields consequences in which she consciously or unconsciously sabotages her own chances for beginning a different lifestyle with reputable employment and education.  Others outside of her gang world certainly haven&#8217;t an ounce of sympathy for gang members like Alesha and a sense of empathy is as close as another planet.  For few of us can even imagine this poignant, tragic lifestyle endured on a daily basis!One doesn&#8217;t enjoy this story but must acknowledge that it&#8217;s a necessary one that needs to be told.  For this astute author deeply believes that the public needs to acquire awareness of just how imprisoned these feral youths are in their own insecurities, fears, and the veneer of toughness.  One realizes how Alesha&#8217;s nasty attitude evolves from rejection to deep-seated anger that breaks out after any innocent or flagrant trigger appears.  One senses how sharing her story turns into a gross betrayal beyond words toward the end of the novel and another event will practically shatter her forever. No, it&#8217;s not far-fetched; it&#8217;s so very real, shocking!This novel was based on the actual 2011 Blackberry London riots.  Polly Courtney, kudos to you for taking on such a huge task of delineating the world of the disenfranchised, of those with no hope and no future.  Whether they succeed or fail, the Miss Merfields of this world deserve even more acclaim for attempting to bring hope to youth who have no basis of believing in anything beyond their criminal and hard-hearted environment!  Words are inadequate to convey the impact of this story that deserves world-wide attention &#8211; for it isn&#8217;t only England&#8217;s problem &#8211; it&#8217;s ours, wherever we live!

A3205Z96VCJAEO,0373210965,Waiting For Wentworth,"[1, 1]","From beginning to end, Heartbeat was such an emotional and heartbreaking story. Emma is dealing with a very difficult situation: her pregnant mother has been declared brain dead after an aneurysm, and her step-father, Dan, has made the decision to keep her body alive and on machines in order to save the baby.Emma visits her mother in the hospital every day, and every day it gets harder and harder for her to keep her thoughts and feelings to herself. She is trying to mourn her mother's death, but it is impossible when she sees her mother's body every day. She feels that her mother and the baby should be allowed to die, and she is angry at Dan for making such a huge decision without asking her opinion first. Emma is hurt and filled with pain and anger, which causes her to lash out at Dan repeatedly. She is often unreasonable, and blames her step-father for everything. It was SO easy to feel sympathy for Emma, but she isn't a likable character. I don't think she's meant to be likable, and that's okay. I was still able to care about her and her situation.Emma feels that her life is completely out of control until she lays eyes on Caleb at the hospital. She recognizes something in him, and they make a connection that they both desperately need. Emma can be herself around Caleb, and doesn't have to hide how much she is hurting. They spend time together and share their grief, knowing that they can't heal the other, but they can at least offer support and understanding.Caleb wasn't at all what I expected, and I found myself really liking him. He has a tragic past, heavy family issues, and terrible, awful parents. I liked that he and Emma were able to make such an unlikely connection. I thought their relationship was beautiful and complex, and they were really able to help each other.Emma's best friend, Olivia, was awesome and so understanding. She is Emma's link to life 'before', and she tried so hard to be there for Emma and support her no matter what. Emma was really lucky to have such a great friend in her life who cared about her so much.Even though Dan was made out to be the bad guy, I tended to side with him because I could relate to him more. I could totally understand his reasons for wanting to save the baby - he knows his wife is dead and the baby will be like having a piece of his wife still with him everyday. If there is the chance that the baby can survive, he is willing to do anything to make it happen.This subject is such a current controversial issue. I can understand the arguments for and against, and whether it is ethical to keep a pregnant woman alive to be an 'incubator'. I do believe the woman's wishes should be taken into account, along with the viability of the fetus. I thought all of these things were handled very well in Heartbeat.

A1X1ZS55QVPU1T,0306811839,Reel To Real,"[1, 1]","This is a disturbing biography for many reasons. I give it four stars because anyone who is fascinated by and wants to learn more about Serge Gainsbourg, as well as Jane Birkin, should read it. Why is it disturbing? First of all, the author, who prides herself on translating the titles of his songs, tells the reader (page 56) that the line in his most famous song 'Je t'aime, moi non plus' (in French only the first word of a song title is capitalized): ""je vais et je viens entre tes reins"" translates to English as ""I come and go between your kidneys."" What? The correct translation, which everyone knows (why didn't she?), is 'between your loins.' Okay, I'm carping about something irrelevant to the substance of the book. However, when it comes to substance, there is barely enough to convey a broad sense of the man and his life. Content is sketchy and woefully thin. What is disturbing is learning how unlikeable a character Gainsbourg actually was. He is the ultimate teflon upstart who charms everyone, gets what he wants, and gets away with everything. You might say 'what's wrong with that?' What's wrong is that he comes across as being too clever by half. I wanted to like him. The more I learned about him however, the less sympathetic I became. The author's juiciest source of information about Gainsbourg comes from her interviews with Jane Birkin. Gainsbourg was attracted to adolescent-like girls. When he met Birkin she was a prolonged adolescent young woman, the perfect type for him. Through her we catch glimpses of Serge at his control-freak worst. Since she is his chief apologist and ever-faithful fan, the real worst is yet to be revealed. What is REALLY disturbing, is what Birkin reveals about what she put up with in their relationship and how she defends Gainsbourg's immorality when it comes to his treatment of their daughter Charlotte. Birkin has some good insights about him, but when she says he was ""never cruel or violent"" she comes across as deluded. I was amused by her telling of the time she threw herself in the Seine to show how upset she was with herself (not with him) for embarrassing him in a nightclub bar. She didn't miss her opportunity to jump in the river, as unhappy French women in Paris occasionally do to express their despair. In the end it is clear that Gainsbourg and Birkin deserved each other. For him, she was the only one who could retain such tender feelings and tolerate his behavior for so long, to his everlasting benefit. What it says about Jane however, is sad.",4.0,DISTURBING,1392940800.0,"02 21, 2014"

Currently I am doing a case study on power and this book has accompanied that aspect well. While I don't agree with America asserting itself as a global power militarily, or even to some extent politically, I still find Zbigniew's assertions quite interesting, concise and correct. He delves into essentially a few subjects (summarized on page 185 in a report card): the Atlantic Alliance, Post-Soviet Space, Far East, Middle East, Proliferation, Peacekeeping, Environment and Global Trade/Poverty, with an emphasis on the first 5 subjects.His analysis of the roles in which these three presidents have played is, in my belief correct on all counts. Bush I was in the B range, Clinton in the C range and Bush II recieved an F. He was most critical of Bush II and most supportive of Bush I, while mixing both sentiments with Clinton. In my belief his support and criticism of all 3 has been rightful. He has asserted that America has fielded badly in its foreign policy and has gradually diminished its global status and influence while only strengthening its military in a world where almost daily we see how hard power and militaristic power is critically limited, while at the same time it diminishes soft power which inturn further limits and weakens hard power again.Many may inteperet Brzeinski's final chapter (Beyon 2008) differently, however in my eyes the following must be done in terms of foreign policy and the international community: America must retract and contract itself militarily while asserting an atlantic alliance more so on a political and economic basis as an equal partner rather than on military and defence basis as an elite protector. It must downsize its military bases and military spending, improve its domestic situation (especially eduaction and information) in order to create a politically active and inforemd society, reduce its political and economic support for Israel and become a moderator rather than remain partial. Hopefully in doing so America will reduce its impreial image to a growing developing world with anti-American sentiment and increase its soft power and improve mutual relationships, wether bilateral, trilateral or multilateral.This is a great read although at times his writing style was antognizing to read.

Casi McLean starts her book with her memories as a happy and loving child, and then moves through her life building the suspense.  What is the secret that her mother never shared?  Why does it have such an affect on her life and her relationships?  I particularly liked her description of high school in the late 60's.  It evoked the era so poignantly and realistically.  I also loved the way she intertwines her actual journal with the book, quoting excerpts as she goes along.  The painful honesty and soul searching are so touching that I felt overwhelmed by her pain.  Then the ending was inspirational and joyful.

When the time comes to remove the staples, the effect of these bends must be neutralized. This device accomplishes that task by inducing a 180 degree bend in the middle of the staple (the portion that is above the skin). One slides the &#34;tongue&#34; of the remover under the staple, centers it carefully and then squeezes the crimper causing the aforementioned 180 degree bend AND, at the same time, pulling the now-vertical staple ends up and out of the skin. It is painless and trivially easy. The only way to goof it up is to fail to center the tongue. Do not make that error or you may render the staple trapped in which case you'll need a chainsaw to remove it. Otherwise the whole procedure should cause no more than a gallon of blood loss tops.Seriously, these ARE easy to use, but if you at all squeamish or nervous about the process, have your surgeon or some other trained medical person remove your staples.",5.0,EASY AS PIE...

Or if you're compulsive like me, an afternoon and evening of good fun. I liked it, yes I did. I liked it because Bylina threaded a contemporary issue through a murder mystery. The issue? Why cannot a Catholic priest serve God while married? Bylina doesn't get real deep into the philosophy, but he does remind us it doesn't derive from Biblical mandates.Back to the mystery: money and lust. That's the engine. That always makes for good fun. Also a genuinely likable hero, which we have in Bylina's detective, who attempts to solve the crime while dealing with a teething baby. And the second protagonist, a nice young church musical director, fits perfectly into the narrative.Bylina brings in other elements that add to the realism -- racism, for one. I like the way he handled that insidious poison. And he didn't make it cliche -- the setting is Pennsylvania, and the young heroine is half-Mexican.What he also does well is weave in backstory to flesh out the narrative. That's always good, right? Makes a reader wan t to cheer.Be prepared for some super good plot twists. When he pulled the first one, I thought &#34;Wow! I did not see that coming.&#34;There's a lot to like about this mystery, and -- well, I understood the conclusion, but darn, I'm not sure it fit with my idea of the way things should turn out.

Catching Jordan was so good, I reread  it twice. Omg. And I hate rereading books, because I'm already going to know what's going to happen. But I guess not with Catching Jordan. ;DThe Cover:It's cute. The bike thing while holding hands. This is random but my brother rode on a  horse while holding hands with his wife for an engagement picture. This cover is kind of like that, but a younger version for teens.The Character:I really love how Miranda Kenneally's characters from the last two books appear in this book. We get to see more of the Jordan-Sam relationship and Parker-Will relationship, which I totally crave and ship. The third book introduces a new couple, Kate and Matt.Matt - Matt went to Cumberland Camp before when he was younger. Back then, he was quiet, shy, geeky. People teased him, bullied him, etc. He almost went suicidal. Until, he met Kate. Kate, who changed how he viewed himself and who kept him alive. Now, he's confident. He's funny, popular, hot. he had a girlfriend named Sarah. They had a three year relationship but they broke up. And Matt was so not expecting to fall in love. Again. With the girl he fell in love with so long ago.Okay, so Matt. Yep. The love story you would imagine. You meet him at camp. You fall in love. You date. Happily ever after. But Kate just couldn't do that.Kate - Kate is really religious. I have nothing against religious people, but she is so religious that I just want to kill her sometimes. And annoying. Like ohmyfreakingawd, what's wrong with you? Apparently, talking to a guy alone is sinning. And I'm like omfg girl, man up. And of course, kissing, making out is way out of hand. I get the no sex thing, but like no holding hands or talking? No wonder you don't have friends.What I like though, is that in a way, characters all connect to each other. Like despite Kate being way down low in the popularity chart, she was still able to go to one of Jordan's popular parties. ;DParker - Parker was already introduced in Stealing Parker. As of she's the main character. Either way, she kind of played a role in this book. She encouraged Kate and Matt's relationship and Parker and Kate actually ended up becoming friend which is good. There are a lot of relationships in this book, but it's cute and all.The Extras:If you haven't gotten the connection yet, Kate goes to Hundred Oaks High School.

On one level, it's incredibly sad to see the story of young lives ripped away when many would say it's too soon and it was a waste. On another, it uplifting to see the incredible faith and strength that these families displayed through the difficulties of missionary work and the devastation of losing the men in their lives. I think it would be hard to read this book as an unbeliever and take much from it beyond that it was a senseless tragedy. Looking at it from my perspective though, I find it challenging and something that everyone who calls themselves a Christian should read at least once in their life to experience what these families went through.There's just not much to say about this book really.

As I said, this app would be a great app for family members to always send nice cards to each other without paying a penny, but, because the designers of the cards made them the way they they are, it can't be used for that purpose.

A1NLVZ294AUJ4P,6305191867,Moviefanatic12,"[6, 6]","After 20 years, Henry remains one of the most compelling horror films ever made. The basic premise - a slice of life approach to the daily activities of a serial killer - had been done before (Bill Lustig's nauseating ""Maniac"") as well as since (the overrated ""Man Bites Dog""), but none approached the impact or verisimilitude of John McNaughton's chiller.Michael Rooker's intense offering is probably the only rendition of a serial killer that gives me nightmares. He seethes with rage and internal brokenness, and with the character of Otis, Tom Towles creates an inimitable caricature of a grotesque clown. Observing his progression from tortured accomplice to drooling necrophiliac is both disturbing and, occasionally, hilarious. In the audio commentary, McNaughton points out the humor that can be appreciated if you can tolerate the stench long enough to locate it. In the most reductive sense, Henry and Otis can be viewed as homicidal buffoons. Their reparte - particularly a post murder bit in a fast food parking lot, and Otis' ""slow on the uptake"" response when Henry hands him a gun in order to kill somebody - can be viewed as nihilistic Abbott and Costello bits.The film's shortcomings mostly enhance its impact. The lack of funds necessitated a harsh, occasionally underlit 16mm look that makes the goings-on all the more realistic. This film is a masterpiece of aesthetic minimalism. Few directors have made equally powerful films under the umbrella of slick hollywood productions.The DVD presentation is first rate. The transfer is clear, and the supplements - particularly a cache of deleted scenes, and a thorough doc present on a second disc - include pretty much everything a ""Henry"" fan could ask for.",5.0,THIS is horror!,1258070400.0,"11 13, 2009"

It smelled really wonderful but the scent was too strong to keep in a frequently used area, so I moved it a little further away from where people normally sit and then the smell was really nice.But in just a couple of days I could no longer smell the scent from that distance so I decided to move it into a small 1/2 bathroom. It did its job nicely for two more days and then there was no longer any noticeable scent. There was still plenty of liquid in the reservoir, so I picked it up and shook the unit gently. After a gentle shake I could sniff it closeup and the pleasant scent was still there. But it no longer produced a noticeable scent that would even slightly permeate in the small bathroom, its scent was only available if I physically put the unit near my nose.

On 10/10/2012 the second unit stopped displaying a picture but still played audio.  On 10/11/2012 I tried to return it to the store for my replacement and Target store informed me the warranty was handled through the phone, so I called Target and they stated the Philips warranty of one year needed to be completed before the Target replacement warranty could be used.  On 10/20/2012 I called Philips for their help in this matter.  they stated the unit was indeed out of warranty and if I truly did buy it on 1/14/2012 I would need to provide a valid proof of purchase and would need to provide them with a CC# in for a 25$ security fee in order for a replacement to be shipped out. On 10/20/2012 I emailed them a scan of the receipt.  I emailed them the next day to confirm they received it, no response.  I called them and they said they were working on it.  On 11/2/2012 I received a cable and I called Philips once again and asked what was going on.  I again informed them I already tried a replacement cable and it did not work (I stated this on 10/20 as well).  Philips told me it was a ""special"" cable and you could not buy it in stores, well, I Ohmed it out and it was a standard video to video cable.  At this phone call on 11/2/2012 I gave Philips my CC# and said I needed a replacement ASAP, they stated it would take 5-10 days to arrive then said the RMA return deposit had increased to 50$--odd.  On 11/12/2012 I called and the person stated their policy changed and it would now take 10-15 days to receive--odd.  On 11/17/2012 I called Philips again questioning the arrival of said replacement unit and they said I should receive it any day.  On 11/22/2012 I called again and they said it was on its way and I should receive it any day.  Finally this last Saturday, 12/1/2012 I was told they were having technical difficulties and they could not tell me whether it had shipped, where it was, if it did ship, and they could not track it at all.

The best Nerf guns are more fun and less expensive.On the plus side, it's very easy to use, and loading the ammo is a snap. We haven't had many misfires or jams. The plastic is decent -- it's not especially heavy duty, but it ain't exactly dollar-store quality, either. The little zombie target is pretty neat, and works as advertised. Hits result in red splotches that fade away after a few minutes. It's light enough to put up with a small tack but heavy enough that it won't tear.On the minus side, we're a little disappointed with the power and accuracy. The effective range only seems to be around 25-30 feet. (Bearing in mind that the ammo is barely large enough to be visible at that distance in bright sunlight, so even if the gun did fire farther, it would be nearly impossible to adjust your aim at longer range.) I suspect that lithium batteries would bump up the power, but those get expensive quickly. As for the accuracy, it's alright for target shooting, but don't expect to hit a moving person at farther than about 15 feet.The ""scope,"" literally just a plastic tube that mounts to the top of the barrel, is for looks only. It's essentially the same as peering through a paper towel roll. You can leave it off if you like.On one hand, the dry ammo is conveniently small when stored. On the other, you have to soak it for 90 minutes before using it, and once you soak it, you have to keep it sealed if you don't fire it right away, and might have to re-soak it. According to the manufacturer, the ammo material is biodegradable and was originally developed for the purpose of hydrating crops. You don't want to eat it, but it shouldn't harm your lawn or foliage.The verdict?

It's easy to figure out how to do basic things like printing, copying, etc., without needing a manual. My problems have been when I've tried to duplex print or scan multiple pages into a pdf rather than a jpg. If I throw the docs in and either through the machine or my computer select 'scan' it automatically scans them into individual pages in jpg format without an easy option or selection for type of file I want. I couldn't quickly and easily figure out how to duplex print either. The manual refers most things to the cd-rom which lacks instructions for both of these issues.

While they are pretty quick to respond, the instructions are long, as in 12-15 steps, and sometimes a bit unclear, often leaving out key things ie: after duplex printing, you actually have to go back in to the software and deselect that feature. Otherwise the printer later jams or thinks it has jammed because it's still trying to print in duplex mode. I haven't been able to get a receipt of confirmation after I've faxed, only if the doc didn't go through. The manual covers the journal, but not the receipts.I never had these issues with any of my HPs. They are just touch and go. When scanning, I'd throw the doc or picture on, hit go and the software would automatically pop up and ask how I wanted it saved, where, and if I had any special requests. Easy-Schmeasy. I never needed the manual for anything, let alone having to refer to a cd-rom, a website and emailing tech support. Faxing and everything else was the same way. My only complaint was that the flatbed read a smaller area than the average size copier, so when I would make reduced copies even, it didn't read outside of the standard 8.5x11 size even though it was larger.I'm pretty computer savvy and if I'm having challenges with this, then it would be especially so for someone who isn't.",3.0,Decent Machine But Not Just Touch & Go,1285286400.0,"09 24, 2010"

Hopping and bopping through the mushroom kingdom, collecting coins, and so-on. Needless to say, when I saw this film I was apalled. How it ever made it onto DVD, I will never know. If the screensaver quality prologue at the start of the film isn't enough to scare you away from the movie, you'll soon notice that the film has very little in common with Sherigu Miyamoto's video game classic that it is named after. There are too many continuity issues to list in this short review, so I won't bother. But basically to sum up the film, if you drained Water World, filled it with weird half lizard-half human creatures and put two badly dressed italian americans in the middle of it you'd have Mario Brothers. If you are a die hard Mario fan, this film will deeply offend you. I wouldn't say it should be completely avoided, as it does offer a few un-intentional giggles, but the film itself it [not good].

This book is about a woman named Jocelyn (or Joss) whose parents and sister were killed in a car accident when she was 14. She has moved to Scotland, where her mother was from, to escape the painful memories. Joss has made herself have a tough exterior and not to let emotional things get in her way, which makes her bottle up all of her feelings inside, refusing to talk about her family. Joss moves into a flat with a girl named Ellie, whom she starts to love as a sister. Ellie also has a brother named Braden, and from the moment she meets him, her life will change. He brings out thoughts and feelings in her that she has refused to let surface for years.The author's writing style is excellent and I like that she would have Joss's inner thoughts next to what really came out of her mouth.

I wasn't very happy about that as I had used it only about fifty times.  Roomba offered to replace it with a top of the line scheduling model for a considerably reduced price to compensate for my loss.  However, it would not have a battery, docking station, charger or lighthouse.  I would have to use all the accessories from my old Roomba or buy anything else I needed.Since it was a top of the line model, I elected to get the new one.  I also decided I wanted to get a much better battery than what I had. After considerable research on these batteries from different sellers, I purchased this battery from ShopXtreme and it is an outstanding performance battery.  I believe it is identical to the one sold by iRobot.  In fact, I believe it is better.  It runs for almost two hours before needing recharge.  Before using it, I charged it for 16 hours even though it came with at least a partial charge.The design of their battery makes it impossible to put it in wrong because there is a protrusion which has to match up with the battery compartment and it will only go in one way.  That is important.The key thing to look for is the rating of the mAh, which is the mili-amp hours.  The higher that number, the better the battery is and the longer the run-time will be.  Mine was 3,500 mAh.  The battery sold by Roomba on their website is only 3,000 mAh and costs $89.00.  It doesn't take much to realize that the one at ShopXtreme is a great value.I would also caution you not to buy a NiCad battery which may look very similar to these and will also work in your unit.  It is an easy mistake to make and may be tempting because they cost less and look the same.  However they are the older version batteries much inferior to these and can develop a memory which will result in a short battery life and poor performance.  Make sure it is an Ni-MH.I can't speak for the other vendors, but if you order what I did from ShopXtreme, I am quite sure you will be happy and completely satisfied.",5.0,As good or better than iRobot original... from ShopXtreme,1282780800.0,"08 26, 2010"

Mel didn't spend enough writing time in developing a believable character here, in my humble estimation.Known for his past Gold Eagle novels, both in the Deathlands and Outlanders series, Mel Odom did his best work in the Deathlands series. (But his first foray into the Outlanders series was solid, too. It was his latter written books that were mediocre.)But back to his current work. Rogue Angel starts out in France, and has the reader following archeologist-turned-explorer-turned-TV monster show host-Annja Creed into a web of mystery and suspence. The overall storyline has potential, but the main character, along with the main bad guys, come off way too cookie cutter and one-dimensional and uncolorful.The action sequences are OK, but either come off too comic-bookish or like a computer game, like Tomb Raider. (That's really all I could unfortunately think of while reading this book.)Annja's two new sidekicks here become a timeless duo of an old man and a male model type, both were connected since watching the burning death of their liege, Joan of Arc, centuries before. Unfortunately, they have since become bitter enemies,(but which comes off too comically in the present timeframe.) Overall, the effect of realism just didn't work for me. These two characters could have been fleshed-out more cohesively.Now, I'm not the type of reviewer that tells readers all that happens in any given novel. I hate that. Gives things away, thus ruining anything for the potential reader. Suffice it to say, Mel Odom is a gifted writer at times.

It isn't too long before he - and Agutter, and Doctor John Woodvine - realize he isn't hallucinating.Very well-directed and -acted piece, balancing horror and humor nicely, though not as smoothly and subtly as the contemporaneous The Howling. The balance is carried off by straight-faced and nightmarish surrealism, and the wholesomeness of the genuinely appealing young cast. The clever juxtaposition of American and British culture helps immensely, adding both to the humor and the realism.This is a truly unique piece, not really succeeding either as a comedy or a horror film, yet satisfying somehow on both levels.

A3HEM1WWXXLOUL,B000002WNO,"""douglasnegley""","[8, 8]","I was floored by this CD when I first heard it. First of all, the sound, for a Live show, at Newport in 1967, is good. Second, the band - featuring players like Snooky Young, Joe Newman, Al Grey, Frank Foster, Jerome Richardson, George Duvivier...need I say more - is on high throttle, and obviously enjoying themselves. This Big Band is every bit as 'tight-loose' (if you catch my drift) as Dizzy's in '57, or Terry Gibbs' in '59. In fact, this band reminds me a whole lot of that Gibbs band in the way they swing, and sway, too. Both do great versions of &quot;Flying Home&quot;, also. I think it was the 'sway' that turned a lot of the 'baby-boomers' off to Big Band jazz. Hopefully, it is more appreciated these days, now that Geritol bottles are finding their way into the same generation's cabinents. Seriously, though, it is great, classic American music. This band shows the time period in which the Live recordings were made, also. &quot;Greasy Greens&quot; is a classic 1967-style pop-funk tune. &quot;Tempo's Birthday&quot; is one of my favorites, being both a 'swing' and 'sway' tune, punctuated with classic section 'hits' in the arrangement. Frank Foster's &quot;Misunderstood Blues&quot; is hilarious, as well as bluesy - a kind of 'tip-of-the-hat' to Clark Terry's classic vocal routine of the same variety. &quot;Meet Benny Bailey&quot; is a minor-mode vehicle for Snooky Young to shine on, which he surely does. Then comes the Hampton rhythm-and-blues classic &quot;Hey! Ba-Ba-Re-Bop, with &quot;Hamp's Boogie Woogie&quot; inside of it, and this time, Hamp gets to show his piano chops, the band responding in full throttle. &quot;Flying Home&quot; finds Hamp doing what he does best: killing on the vibes. An encore, apropos of the period, features one more go 'round of &quot;Greasy Greens&quot;, featuring Billy Mackel on the electric guitar solo. The rest of the tracks are studio releases, but this CD ranks with the best Live swinging Big Bands of modern times. It is a hidden treasure.",5.0,Lionel and the All-Star Alumni Band COOKS!

(Wrist rests on the desk, fingertips are the only thing on the mouse, I move the mouse with just my thumb and pinky/3rd finger).- I have small hands (7 inches from my palm to the very tip of my middle finger).- I have used Logitech mice since the MX510 I bought in 2004. I've tried other mice, but they usually just don't work for my kind of  hand and grip. Either they are too large, too tall, or just plain aren't made for people who move the mouse with their fingertips. A great example of this is the Naga 2014. It has a place to rest the user's 3rd finger. It just doesn't work with a fingertip grip because I use that finger to move the mouse.I've really liked other logitech mice like the MX510, G500, and G700.. but I LOVE this mouse. It takes everything that was great about those other mice and makes it easier to use because of a lower profile. The sensor on it feels very accurate and if you want to get into specifics about it, look at some reviews about the new sensor. There is a bunch of stuff I could talk about and bore you to death, but lets just say its an amazing sensor that is very accurate. It will even have you &#34;scan&#34; the surface you use it on to calibrate itself to the surface.Overall this mouse is just amazing for people like me. If you have small hands and use the same kind of grip, I would give this a shot. Even if your current mouse is good enough, go give this one as shot and you won't be disappointed. If you have large hands, use a different grip, or just don't like the shape/profile that Logitech uses with their mice, your mileage may vary.

Turner uses various publicly known intelligence failures as reference points to specific and often very good comments on the structure and processes of intelligence production.

A1QA59ISWKCHHB,0316101621,Lawral Wornek,"[0, 0]","Let me start by saying that you should not judge this book by its cover. Or by its opening lines:""Frailty, thy name is woman."" - William Shakespeare""Willy, thy name is sexism."" - OpheliaDon't get me wrong, both have very much to do with the story (other than Hamlet's hair color on the cover), but they really make this look like a much lighter, funnier, beach read kind of book than it really is. I mean, really, how would one make an adaption of Hamlet light? Instead, this book is everything it should be; it's brooding and dark and, at times, intense. It's also narrated by a strong Ophelia who is understandably worried (and sometimes so tired/drunk she's a bit loopy - how else could one explain the flower scene?) about her boyfriend's apparent loss of sanity but who also does her best to be supportive and helpful to those around her, especially her aforementioned boyfriend and her widower father, all while trying to keep her own life together in the midst of circumstances no high school senior should have to deal with. She is so at odds with both the classic and modern versions of how we usually see the character of Ophelia. I loved it.The story stays pretty true to the original, with one major difference that is given away on the jacket flap: Ophelia survives. The motivations behind people's actions, however, are different. The ""truth,"" what Ophelia is telling us the readers, is book-ended by Ophelia's tell-all appearance on fake-Danish-Oprah in the beginning of each chapter and her interrogation by the Danish police at the end. These three concurrent tellings of the same story, illustrate the fabrication of what we take for ""fact"" from the media and the reach of a government cover-up more explicitly than that paparazzi pic on the cover ever could. On faux-prah, Ophelia is sweet, in love, heart-broken, and kind of ditzy. She's the almost princess. While being interrogated, she is bitingly sarcastic, angry, and fiercely loyal to Horatio and Marcellus, the only other people to survive the bloodbath that is this story. She's accused of being the master-mind of a plot to overthrow the Danish monarchy. In between, she's just a girl doing her best to do what's right for herself and those she loves.Really and truly, I loved this book. It sucked me into the story and kept me on the edge of my seat even though I knew, more or less, what was going to happen. The characters were well-rounded and real in ways that Shakespeare characters usually are not. I cried when the king died. Have you ever cared about Hamlet's dad enough to even care that he's dead? I haven't. And Hamlet himself made a bit more sense, not a lot, but a bit. Giving him a happy background with Ophelia, at least in flashbacks, made their whole relationship much more believable which made it all the more crushing when he becomes cruel. Michelle Ray has managed to take a story that I already knew well and liked, and she made it into something new and original that I love.

Then 3 weeks ago, the kids dropped their IPad 1 and absolutely destroyed it, because someone forgot to put on the Otterbox Auntie sent them. There is a moral to this story &#60;g&#62;. ;-)So, since the children's life and education was on their ipad, a replacement needed to be found. Luckily, Auntie just upgraded to the IPad Air and had my old IPad 1 just sitting in its box. So, I made a big care package and just sent it to them (it was tough as it looked brand new and I knew what it would look like in just 3 days &#60;vbg&#62; ;-)However, this time it was in an Otterbox which I was very tempted to superglue closed &#60;eg&#62;! Looking at that bulky, heavy and ugly Otterbox, I wished I could have replaced it with something much lighter, and cooler from Fintie, but could nit find anything. However, I did find Fintie's Galaxy cases, that I am discussing here, and included them in the gift box.When I decided I also wanted to protect their Galazys, but without spending lots of money, I turned to Fintie. I think they make some of the best cases, for the lowest prices! I bought each or the shield series for under $5 each! Go figure, as they told me the otterbox they looked at was about $100? Anyway, the point is, the Fintie cases I bought made the Otterbox look heavy, bulky and not nearly as nice looking. Even if it would protect my phone from a nuclear explosion, there is no way I would out that thing on my phone!I received a call from my very grateful relatives a week later. They loved the Ipad (of course, it was free &#60;g&#62;)! They said that the Galaxy note shield fit liked a glove, they loved it, and agreed it was a great alternative to the expensive otterbox.Just so you know, the Fintie cover is really constructed well, and will protect from much dust, dirt and water drops.It also has great coverage of all ports and it's jacket fits just perfectly. Although their is no front cover, I just sent them the top of the line screen savers. This saves a lot of weight and I still think their phones will be very safe. Besides, I just got their kids a new used IPad so mommy and daddy should keep their phone hidden from the kids &#60;g&#62;. Auntie has no more extra phones and pads if these break &#60;g&#62;. ;-)Bottom line is, if you have young children, get a heavy duty case. :)You don't need to spend a fortune because Fintie makes a great alternative at a wicked low price.

AYA29XLPT24EA,B000053306,AmazonReviewer,"[1, 1]","The following is not medical advice, but only one individual's response to a previous misleading negative review:Regarding puncture wounds:  A puncture wound, once carefully inspected for debris, cleaned, and treated with antiseptic ointment, should be fully covered using a bandage to prevent reintroduction of bacteria, and the wound should be re-cleaned and re-dressed (ointment and bandage(s) reapplied) as appropriate during the healing process.  (Of course, as with any wound, you should also monitor for any sign of infection and consult a medical professional immediately if any of these signs develop.  This step is especially important with puncture wounds, as one of the biggest risks of puncture wounds is infection caused by bacteria and/or foreign objects which cannot be reached and/or removed during irrigation and cleansing of the wound.)Regarding butterfly closures:  A butterfly closure would never be able to accomplish any wound coverage effectively since not only is it extremely narrow in the middle, but also there is no wound protection pad in the middle of the closure, as is the case with an adhesive bandage.  (It also does not have adhesive across the middle, of course, so as not to get adhesive in the wound.)You will notice, perhaps, that it is not even called a bandage, but a closure. There is a reason for this. It is designed help hold a laceration closed.  It is used to apply tension from either end of the closure toward the middle across a laceration to help hold the laceration together while healing.  It is applied at a right angle to the length of the laceration, in the direction that a surgical stitch would be applied, and is used for a similar purpose as a surgical stitch on wounds that are more than superficial but not serious enough to require stitches.  Longer lacerations may require more than one closure, applied in parallel to the laceration.  In addition to these closures, such lacerations should then also be covered using a large bandage, as should most simple scrapes and wounds,  to prevent introduction of bacteria while healing (and they too should be re-cleaned, re-dressed, and checked for infection as appropriate).Regarding Band-Aid brand adhesive bandages in general, and its butterfly closures in particular: Band-Aid products are some of the best adhesive bandage products on the market.  I am not affiliated with Johnson & Johnson except as a consumer.  However, since I somewhat frequently rely on these closures to avoid the need for stitches and since, in my opinion, their brand is the best butterfly closure on the market, I wanted to do my best to set the record straight regarding this product.Further information regarding wound care:  By the way, because it sounds like you might be attempting to apply bandages to wounds on which the bleeding might not yet have slowed, you also might be interested in researching how to apply mild compression to a wound for a few minutes in order to slow, if not stop, the bleeding in order to allow for a more successful bandage application.  In addition, the skin to which the adhesive of the bandage must stick should be dry in order to obtain the best adhesion. Further, the bandage should be re-applied if it has gotten wet, such as during hand-washing, etc.Of course, as you mentioned, one can also rely on gauze pads with first aid tape.In closing, please accept my sincere hope for better experiences and outcomes during wound care for both you and your family members.",5.0,This product works great; please disregard the negative reviews from one man with an ax to grind about Band-Aids,1349049600.0,"10 1, 2012"

A1MP5ZMAFXBJR1,B00H3OYSHW,juancarlos olivares,"[2, 3]","The New Trent Airbender Pro is a case that I would recommend to just about anyone, that does not mind adding a little weight to their iPad.  The case comes in two parts.  One part keyboard and one part all enclosing case with screen protector.The case that covers the back of the iPad and the screen is very well made.  I feel that my iPad is safer with the case than without the case.  It could probably be dropped a little with little to no damage to the iPad.  The screen protector, which is attached to the case, also covers the display along with the front facing camera well.  Alongside the screen protector is a rubber border, which also extends to the back, that protects the iPad if dropped face down.  In that case the border would take the impact.  This is more seen on cell phones.As far as the keyboard goes, it is roomy enough and it gets the job done.  I am actually writing this review using the keyboard.  The keys click and are responsive to the touch.  And I feel comfortable using it for more than a brief period.Now onto my concerns.  As stated above this is a really good product.  That being said, no product is perfect and the following I feel is something that a potential buyer should be aware of.-The screen protector has a kind of rainbow effect when the screen is not on.+This is not noticeable when the iPad is on.-The screen protector makes iPad more reflective than without having it on.+This was more of a problem playing games than watching videos.-The keyboard has a plastic flap, used to latch onto the iPad part of the case preventing it from coming open, right below the space bar.  The flap folds up so that when you are typing on the keyboard your right hand thumb will hit the flap while typing.+This is actually a little bit more annoying.Overall I would rate the New Trent Airbender Pro a solid 4 out of 5.  If I was rating the screen case alone it would be a 4.5 and the keyboard a 3.5.",4.0,A good affordable case that protects and adds more functionality.,1392163200.0,"02 12, 2014"

The reason I am giving this book 5 stars is because not only was the story engaging, but it was fast paced and I could identify with one of the main characters, Steve. Like him, I was upset with Western Medicine and how I felt and sometimes do still feel dismissed. It was in Eastern medicine combined with Western medicine that I found many of my issues able to be controlled. One of the main things in the book when Steve does something to his doctors that many may find reprehensible is to get them to both realize that one needs to ""marry both types of medicine together"". I could not agree more.The only thing I found about this book that bugged me was at the end when the author describes Steve and Paul's childhood adventures in a specific location. I thought this information could have been scattered throughout the book but it was not enough for me to drop a star of my rating. The ending chapter was a nice ending and a surprise ending at the best. I did not see it coming and honestly, many readers may not see it coming.This book is staying on my Kindle to be read again if I meet my challenge goals before the end of 2012.

A3T8Y73DOFUIR6,079215455X,S. Smith-Peter,"[2, 2]","Set in the Texas Panhandle during Woodrow Wilson's presidency, the film technically is about a love triangle between Bill (Richard Gere) Abby (Brooke Adams) and a rich farmer (Sam Shepard).  Bill and Abby, who are traveling along with Bill's sister, Linda (Linda Manz), pretend to be brother and sister but are really lovers.  Things go fine until the farmer is taken with Abby.What strikes me is that nature is really the subject of the film, particularly in the first half. The characters are almost entirely outside.  Heaven in this part deals with the heavens, the skies, as we see many shots of people backlit against a vast sky.  Bill and Abby even sleep out in the hay when it snows.  Their relationship, although it provokes some taunting by fellow migrant workers, isn't presented as fundamentally problematic.  They're living in a state of nature.Then, however, Bill convinces Abby to let the farmer court and marry her.  A key scene is where Bill enters the farmer's house, which has up until then been a looming presence on the horizon, but not an interior experience.  Now Bill has entered into a new world and is no longer in a state of nature.  Here is where Linda comes into her own.  She finally has a place and doesn't have to work all the time and is learning quite a bit from the farmer.  But Richard Gere has to come back and mess it all up (like he has many a movie).  His second return sets in motion the tragedy the experienced viewer has been expecting, and the emotional detonation is intense.I don't understand why so many people complained about the emotional minimalism.  Frankly I found it a relief to not have to have every turn explained, foreshadowed, and repeated again and again. Everything was implied rather than stated.  That shows respect for the viewer rather than any lack of mastery.",5.0,Beautiful meditation on nature and humanity,1293321600.0,"12 26, 2010"

A1X69RZ08LRNGL,B004N625AK,steve_oakland,"[2, 2]","This is a good router, optimized for people who like out-of-the-box functionality. It's preconfigured to work and get up and running quickly once you install a bit of software. I installed this router for my parents so they could give it a try. The wireless-N range is EXCELLENT: as I could get a strong signal through several walls and > 150 feet away. This was a nice improvement as it facilitated working at more locations around their house.PROS:1. If you are not picky about settings and have a simple home network setup, this works more or less right out of the box. A real random password is pre-configured, so you don't even have to worry about changing or setting the security yourself if you don't want to. This is better than setting no security at all, which a lot of people do given how common it is to find unsecured WiFi networks in many areas. A handy card can be stored underneath the router so in case you forget your network name or password, it is right where you need it.CONS:1. I'm not keen on having to install special software to configure the router. The packaged software was quite slow to install on my Macbook. Beyond basic features, the advanced features must be programmed in by a web interface by typing in the IP address of the router into your browser. If that's the case, why even have the installation and configuration software?2. While the default settings were easy to navigate, setting up advanced settings and changing the password wasn't necessarily easy. As mentioned, advanced settings must be changed via a browser interface, and there is nothing of a step-by-step guide.

A2SYP4XQ853PSK,0816644888,"Caroline Nelson ""Muffy""","[0, 0]","Multicultural Politics is a VERY worthwhile read. Modood challenges traditional conceptions of identity and racism by exploring the experience of South Asian Muslims in Britain. He seeks to achieve an understanding of society that is ""anchored in the comprehension of agents themselves.""  The most persistent voice is his own, which infuses his arguments with the passion of a child whose ""privileged middle-class life"" in Pakistan was disrupted by his family's immigration to Britain in 1961.After analyzing ethnic statistics in Britain, Modood argues that the divide is not a black-white divide but ""a divide between white, Chinese, African Asian, and Indian men on the one hand, and Bangladeshi, Pakistani, and Caribbean men on the other.""  Referencing the 20% of whites under 35 who admitted to being prejudiced against Asians in the 1986 Survey Report,  Modood argues that this prejudice is primarily against Muslims and that ""cultural racism"" exists in tandem with and often as a second step to ""color racism.""  While a quarter of whites attend a place of worship at least once a month, two-thirds of Muslims attend at least once a week.  These statistics form the basis of Modood's claim that the movement to eliminate color racism excluded Asians by lumping them into the ""black"" category with which they could not identify.""In locating oneself within a hostile society,"" Modood writes, ""one must begin with one's mode of being, not one's mode of oppression.""  Modood cites evidence of Britain's ""hostile society"" in the BNP,  adverse immigration laws,  and ""Paki-bashing"" in the police force  when Muslims confront the highest level of attacks on person and property.  He also alleges discrimination against Muslims in education and employment. Muslims are underrepresented in prestigious jobs,  and a BBC Radio experiment discovered that identical CVs submitted to 50 firms yielded interviews for 23% of applicants with white names compared to 9% with Muslim names.  Modood also points to indirect discrimination that favors locals, requires work on Friday's, or frowns upon Muslim dress.  However, he rejects Rex's theory that ethnicity is artificially determined by group conflict  and Smith's theory that it is formed by resistance to oppression.  Ethnicity is not, as Miles contends, a ""false doctrine""  and it is not ""voluntary,"" as Banton suggests. Modood asserts that real collectivities exist, and defines them through five dimensions, including ""cultural distinctiveness"" and ""identity.""He extends this analysis by arguing for a ""state policy of multiculturalism"" that views the country as more than a liberal association of autonomous individuals.  He asserts the ""positive right"" of minorities to ""share in the public domain, including law, in order to live by communal values even where those values run counter to majority values and lifestyles.""  While criticizing the effective ""establishment"" of Anglicanism in the British constitution,  he argues that radical secularism also privileges the dominant ethnic group by forcing minorities to follow its normative legal ideal.  Instead he proposes a ""plural state,"" which recognizes both communities and individuals as actors and gives the former ""a formal representation or administrative role"" to play in the state, thereby offering a holistic emotional identity.Modood's proposal fails to take Islam's pluralism into account. The very act of ""institutionalizing some public space for religions""  runs contrary to his fluid concept of identity. Modood asserts that he does not believe in ""discrete, bounded populations of cultural absolutes""  and expects a group to ""change, develop, adopt, borrow, and synthesize"".  His proposal would marginalize minorities within Islam by creating a formal dialogue in the public sphere. Who will represent the Shi'a? Who will represent the 50% of Muslims who do not approve of state-funding for parochial schools or the youth who continue to identify with Islam without speaking South Asian languages, attending a mosque, or having arranged marriages?A second cause for concern lies in Modood's definition of incitement to religious hatred. He compares the statement ""Jesus Christ was a homosexual"" with ""Prophet Muhammad was a lewd, dishonest, dissembling power seeker"" and concludes that the former is permissible but that the latter isn't because it criticizes a belief that is ""part of the primary self-identification of a group.""  By forcing speech to contribute to ""constructive dialogue,""  Modood places speech under subjective control. This act is a slippery slope to stifling academic inquiry. The ability of subversives within a religion to challenge the ascendant interpretation is essential to its fluid identity. Like his call for a ""plural state,"" restricting offensive speech hardens the boundaries of identity that Modood ostensibly prefers remain ""soft.""",4.0,Food for Thought--but riddled with inconsistencies,1138752000.0,"02 1, 2006"

Meanwhile, Amy's friend, Jenelle, suspects that her boyfriend, Anderson, might be breaking up with her, since he's spending so much time with Kiwi, and Michiko still won't admit to Amy that she has a crush on Amy's older brother, even though all the signs are there.Fiona, on the other hand, seems to be losing her place in ""The League"" of popular girls to Lucia, her old second-in-command whose prank drove the wedge between Amy and Fiona, and Amy doesn't know if she should feel sorry for Fiona or pleased that she is finally getting what she deserves.Amidst all this, Preston keeps pestering Amy about joining the committee for planning the seventh grade prank, and Amy is hesitant to do so. However, she realizes that Preston does not seem nearly as annoying as he used to, and she doesn't know how she should feel about that, either. While her crush, the eighth grader Scott, keeps giving her mixed signals, Amy wishes that, for once, boys and girls could just be honest with each other and clearly let others know how they feel. But her genuine wish could spell disaster for her friendships, all of which seem to be teetering on the brink of madness. It's anyone's guess how this Crazy Week will end, but it's obvious that nothing will ever be the same again once the school year is over.A fine end to a fine series, one can appreciate Amy's level-headed approach to relationships, as well as her struggle to navigate her way through this emotional end of the year for the seventh graders of Allington Academy.Reviewed by:  Allison Fraclose",5.0,Courtesy of Teens Read Too,1287014400.0,"10 14, 2010"

So, I wrapped the tube ends in paper towel and tied it up with some metal wire and put a piece of cardboard on top of my graphics card, just in case.  Installation was easy, cleaning off/applying more thermal paste was cake, and now my CPU clocks to 4.5ghz and is staying around 60C, which is plenty low for haswell chips.  So far, this has saved me from needing to delid the CPU to get the clock speed I wanted.  The pump is quiet, when my case fans are on low, the whole computer is nearly silent.  The loudest thing is the 7950 graphics card, and even it is extremely manageable.TL;DR:  I was worried about it leaking after reading some reviews, wrapped the tube ends in paper towel just in case, and have had no problems in the 3 months I've had it.

The Tiffany jewelry, chandeliers, blowing white curtains and winding staircase are the stuff of imagination.  The twenties at their peak.  The acting however, and the screenplay failed to fulfill this magnificent book.  De Caprio is not Redford; for the better part of the movie he sounds as though he is trying to speak like a Kennedy.  He finally comes into the character in the last scenes, and in those, is really good.  Toby McGuire is vacant; without the writing tool used in the movie he has no personality at all.  Carey Mulligan is a picture of Daisy; the depth of character and beginnings of her madness are not there.  She never has those 'Zelda'  moments which gave meaning to her part in the story.  The best character in this version is Jordan; Isla Fischer is beautiful and conveys her character, the times, everything with only few words; in her facial expression and movement there is a true depth that draws attention.  Found myself wanting to hear more from her.  The story is lost.  There is no mention or appearance of Daisy's child at all until the last; one is left wondering where she came from and when, unless you know the book.  The best part of the screenplay is the use of Fitzgerald's amazing closing lines and the green light......

A25WS09GRNHWCP,8861303439,Claudia,"[15, 18]","Due to the very good reviews on Amazon and because this book says to be a glimpse of the exhibition on Grace Kelly in Monaco (I was unfortunate not being able to visit), I bought this book. As already mentioned by others, it does have a very nice and high quality look and feel, but still, it did not meet my expectations. Being a Grace Kelly Fan, I am sort of disappointed to find many pictures one can already find in many other publications on her. The personal items are very interesting, but there could be more.This book is officially accepted by her family, and it is quite understandable that the image of Grace Kelly had to be a positive one, just like she had wished, as one of her quotes in this book states. But another of her quotes also shows, that she did not seem consistently happy with her fairy tale image, to which she herself had some cause. Is this maybe a glimpse of one extreme in her personality? I think it would have been possible to show more of a ""real"" person, and maybe the exhibition this book is reflecting did so. If so, this book was not made with care.I have read some unauthorized biographies on her and even if they sometimes seem a little too much, too dirty, too revealing, they still appear to describe the life of a human, the ups and downs, the possible reasons for the choices made in life. This book is the absolute contrary, and even seems to be desperately trying to disprove all other books written on her. One example: one nice, short thank you letter from Jacqueline Kennedy-Onassis makes the impression of a harmonious friendship. Other biographies claim their relationship to being quite disturbed, Jacqueline not at all being fond of Princess Grace. Well, maybe the exhibition had more to tell on this issue, so I would have rather seen more letters Grace Kelly wrote than thank you notes from her co actors and other celebrities written with typing machines.Maybe it would have been better just to display as many pictures as possible from the exhibition, with very little text and without any tendentious comments. This would have let the book be more open and would have let the spectator make up his own mind.

A2Q7K78QZEF23U,1557785163,Ravi Ravi,"[7, 67]","I am not sure how to judge this book. Being from India, everything that I know about Islam contradicts this book. Is it another WMD lie but this time by a scholar rather than a government? As I was getting ready to write my comments about this book, I came across another suicide bombing in Iraq leaving over 60 civilians dead. The images of victims, in my opinion, stand a witness that this book is a well intentioned deception. I think seeing is still believing, and what we see today, as well as what history shows us, is that this book is a lie. If this is indeed true Islam, then Islam is best kept secret even to Moslems.Of course, I must say that most of our experiences have been with what we know as Sunni Islam. I did not know anything about Shia version of Islam. Is this book portraying Shia version or Sunni version?  I must say, that I am amazed at the self restraint that Shia is demonstrating in face of their brutal Sunni counter part. If Moslems in India pulled the kind of crap they are pulling in Iraq against the majority, you better believe it there will be massacre in the streets. Imagine if a minority such as Mormons, or Moslems in the US were killing people the way Sunnis are killing Shia in Iraq, I wonder what the response would be from the majority. Do you think we would respond in the same manner as Shia in Iraq? I don't think so. Most probably majority would eradicate this savage population or gather them up all in a camp of some sort. These Shia in Iraq are putting even the most pacifist Buddhists to shame.So if this book is about Sunni Islam, I am not sure if I can buy the claims, too good to be true. Neither the history of Islam confirms this picture nor what we see today on a day to day basis and I am sure the author knows this fact all darn too well.  However if it portrays Shia Islam then maybe it is true I do not know much about Shia version of Islam but from what I see in Iraq they are either too stupid or much too peaceful.At any rate, read this book with suspicion as the available data indicates it is another weapons of mass deception.",3.0,A deception?,1151712000.0,"07 1, 2006"

How wrong I was and how glad I finally found the urge to watch.  True, the story on the face of it is a very simple one (and true) about an old age pensioner from New Zealand who finally realizes his dream to head to Bonneville Salt Flats and find out just how fast he and his motorcycle can go after years of tinkering with it in the shed where he lives in suburbia - but it's the journey that reveals more about the man than the destination itself.At home, his existence is slow and made up of routine (not least, peeing on his lemon tree each day..), and the slowness of his movements as an old man is contrasted with the speed that he dreams of on his bike (The Indian of the title).  As he starts off on his journey we really get a feel for what a transparently nice guy he is, interacting with some random Americans along the way and the movie unabashedly supporting the idea of ""Do as you would be done unto"".  His openness, pragmatic, accepting and trusting nature with a twinkle of mischief winning people inexorably over.. To be fair, it could all be a bit too much niceness and not enough actually happening, but director Roger Donaldson somehow pulls off a hat trick that works if you let it.With a tone reminiscent of the road trip in Middle America ofThe Straight Story, or the unpretentiousness ofThe Dish, this is less excitement, and more slow burn character piece, and as such the success of the movie lies mostly on the shoulders of Anthony Hopkins, in what turns out to be unexpectedly perfect casting.  His accent might be all over the place, but he has nailed the voice of this character's soul perfectly.Photography does justice to both the home scenes in New Zealand, as well as to the expanse of the Bonneville flats in Utah we see towards the end, but it's not the technical details that make this a treat - it's simply that the movies heart is absolutely in the right place.9/10",5.0,"Feel good road trip movie with heart, petrol and a dash of nitro.",1367020800.0,"04 27, 2013"

The book deals with a four month trip around a fascinating, enormous country, and besides reading what Paul did on most days - as in a journal entry, the reader learns that he spent a great deal of his time on the beach swimming, sleeping, eating and then at night, drinking beer! Occasionally one catches a glimpse of the real Paul, a shy man who is frightened of women, is bitter about his ex wife and who would rather smile than confront people who treat him badly. Proofreading would have helped too as there were many grammatical and punctuation errors -perhaps typos - but they irritated me.Would I recommend this book?

My two complaints are that there was no 9V  battery included as stated in the product description, and a big plus would be for the display and buttons to light up. Other than that, it is accurate, easy to attach and lock the stable cradle, and a great value at this price. Did I overlook a battery in the packaging anyone? I confirmed accuracy as I weighed him right before going to the vet who weighed him as well, and it matched.Edit: On further use I was frustrated as my healthy cat was lounging again in the cradle and thought that would be a good time to weigh her. What could be more accurate and convenient than a cat *lounging* in the cradle when you want to weigh it? See pic in the image section to see her on it. Well, with her on it and turning it on you have to zero it first. if you do that with her on it she will weigh zero lbs or kg! What am I missing here? Guess i could take her off the scale and get a negative reading? I will read the booklet again and if it's not possible to weigh properly with the cat already on the scale I may have to remove a star even though this scale is primarily marketed for baby and toddler use. With cats you have to take advantage of opportunity. Not every cat is such a great patient so for cat use my rating would be three stars.Hope to get some feedback on the battery situation and how to properly weigh with the cat already in the cradle.",4.0,Very good value and sturdy.,1280620800.0,"08 1, 2010"

A3O536E2YOKK4Y,B0001JXOUS,Wuchak,"[2, 4]","""The Last Samurai"" is a story about a Civil War veteran who goes over to Japan to fight the last pocket of Samurai; he is taken captive by the Samurai, but eventually learns to respect this dying culture and adapt to their way of life.WHAT WORKS: The movie is beautiful to look at; the cinemtography is magnificent. The story is generally engrossing and it's great to envision how the Samurai may have really lived in Japan hundreds of years ago. Speaking of which, the costumes and sets are outstanding, no doubt about it.WHAT DOESN'T WORK: I enjoyed the movie, I did, but the plot is obviously taken from ""Dances With Wolves,"" a very superior film. One could also cite ""Lawrence of Arabia"" and ""Last of the Dogmen"" as films with similar plots. (Although ""Dogmen"" is basically a rip-off of ""Dances With Wolves,"" the story takes place in the modern world, so it definitely possesses its own uniqueness). The scene in ""Samurai"" where the Samurai make their first dramatic appearance is obviously ripped-off straight from a similar scene in ""Dogmen"" wherein the Indians make their first appearance (compare the two scenes for verification).The score in the film is certainly serviceable but parts of it painfully sound like a watered-down variation of the fabulous score from ""The Last of the Mohicans.""BOTTOM LINE: Although ""The Last Samurai"" could be subtitled ""Dances with the Last Dogmen of Arabia,"" it's still quite enjoyable. People who have not seen these other four movies that so-obviously influenced ""Samurai"" will likely rate ""The Last Samurai"" higher than I have. If you really like this film and haven't seen these other movies I've mentioned, I encourage you to pick 'em up ASAP -- especially ""The Last of the Mohicans"" and ""Dances With Wolves,"" which are two of the best movies ever filmed, period.",3.0,"Likable, but Lacks Originality",1115596800.0,"05 9, 2005"

This book presents 49 articles that show how anthropological training can be applied to solve problems all over the world, from remote jungle villages to American corporations.  I originally purchased this book for use as a supplementary textbook in an introductory Anthropology class, but we only read about half a dozen of the articles.  But I liked the book and wanted to read more.  So now post-graduation I have finally had time to read the entire book.  What I like about it is the breadth of its subject matter.  It pretty much touches upon every aspect of anthropology and there are constant surprises.  Some subjects interest me more than others, so some of the articles were more enjoyable than others.  My favorites were the articles dealing with archaeology and forensic medicine.  The ones I did not like were the political ones in which the authors grind their personal axes.  Some of these were poorly argued, cherry-picking examples while conveniently ignoring contrary evidence.  But I can see their value in provoking classroom discussion.  I would estimate that about ten percent of the book is leftist propaganda, which is relatively small in today's anthropological teaching milieu in America.  A couple of the articles were obviously written by women who hate men so much that they don't even try to mask their misandry.  Another criticism is that some of the articles were already somewhat dated when this edition came out in 2006.  21st Century society changes at a breakneck pace.  In 2006, ""social networks"" were a teenage phenomenon.  Today the average age of Facebook users is well over 40.  This book may be really obsolete now.  There is a new edition of this book, but many professors (like the one I had) prefer older editions that they are familiar with.  In general, I think the book is worthwhile, despite about half a dozen truly expendable articles.  I'd give this book three and a half stars, rounded up to four.",4.0,Basically worthwhile,1380153600.0,"09 26, 2013"

That is quite uncommon for such a beautiful voice of this timbre.  Now if there were indeed a tenor with a dark voice who could tackle such material and do just about anything that the operatic repertoire requires of him, yet maintain a limber quality about his voice when tackling the challenging bel canto repertoire, then we would have Callas reincarnated in the tenor voice (LOL!!).  But truly, this is a gem of a recital.  No other tenor nowadays can perform such challenging material without resorting to unconventional means of singing.  He truly revived the real bel canto voice--fresh, light, yet invigorating in drama.  Drama, I say, is exemplified here not through the typical verismo style we are acquainted to nowadays.  It is rather inflicted upon the soul in the traditional bel canto manner--through embellishments and dramatic singing without sobs or such and so.  He does it with grace.  His florid lines will astound, amaze, and astonish you. His high notes are chesty yet beautiful.

A350TT4A1LNNHY,B00AKIPAG6,B. McDonald,"[22, 29]","""Unconditional"" is an incredibly moving film. It reminded me in several spots of ""Pay It Forward."" The story packs so many emotional scenes and so much drama that I'm tempted to call it manipulative; but I suppose to be fair, every film is ""manipulating"" the viewer in some way. That's the whole point - delivering messages and endeavoring to elicit an emotional response of some kind from the viewer. So again, this film is powerful. The scenes have been put together very well. The directing is strong. The music is fitting and excellent. The acting, especially by the two main characters (Joe and Sam, played by Michael Ealy and Lynn Collins respectively), is really well done. Collins is particularly good.This film bears no Christian labels (of which I'm aware), which is no surprise since Jesus is never mentioned in it. Nevertheless, it seems to masquerade as a Christian film, so I intend to address it from a Christian perspective. (As a Christian, I can't address it from any other perspective anyway.) The story is compelling, even if far-fetched in a few spots. Unfortunately, like the children's stories Sam writes, the message of this film is fantasy. What I mean by that is it is heartbreakingly incomplete. The deep messages that come out of the film are these:1. God loves you.2. You just need to realize it and accept it, and it will change your life.I agree with the first message. God indeed loves everyone. I do not agree with the second message. If we're going to talk about God, then we need to go to the authority on God, which is His Word, the Bible. Looking at the totality of scripture, it is blatantly obvious that the purpose of this brief, human existence is to make sure you enter into eternal life when you leave life here. The Bible is quite clear as to how a person does this. In John 17:3, Jesus said, ""This is eternal life, that they may know you, the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom you have sent."" So there's something very important about knowing Jesus Christ. In John 3, Jesus said, ""Truly, truly, I say to you, unless one is born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God."" And lastly, Romans 10:9 says, ""If you confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved.""The Bible is extremely clear then that entering into eternal life (""going to heaven"" or ""being saved,"" etc.) requires knowing Jesus Christ, being born again, and making Jesus lord. All of these things have their roots in faith, believing things God has revealed to us. ""Unconditional"" doesn't say anything about being born again or about making Jesus lord. However, the film tells us that knowing God just happens if we seek Him. While this can indeed occur, what is missing throughout this film is the most critical piece: Jesus Christ. God has chosen to reveal Himself through His Son (Hebrews 1:1-4). He has chosen to make salvation available only through His Son (John 14:6, Acts 4:11-12). The fact that God loves you is not enough for you to enter eternal life. For a person to realize and accept God's love for them is not enough to enter eternal life. A person must be born again in order to receive the free gift of eternal life.There was a time in my life that I didn't want to live. I never found myself in a rainy alley with a loaded gun under my chin, but I relate to Sam's pain. And as in the film, God's providence placed individuals in my life who told me of His love and pointed me in a new direction. I sought after God for a year and a half, and I managed to change my life in some positive ways. Some of the pain of my past seemed to fade away. However, time and good works and intentions do not heal wounds. They may seem to heal, but they merely submerge in our souls, only to pop back up to surprise us by their enduring strength. Only Jesus Christ heals wounds of the human soul. Only Jesus liberates people from the bondage known as sin. Jesus said that ""everyone who sins is a slave to sin"" (John 8:34), and He effectively covered all mankind with that statement. Sin is without question mankind's greatest problem, and in sending Jesus Christ to set people free from sin, God has met humanity's greatest need. That is the very height of love. When I finally surrendered my life fully to Jesus Christ (made Him lord), believing in all He had done for me, I was born again. I was set free from the penalty for my sin (hell) and from the power of my sin to control my life. From that day, my life has never been the same. I received the free gift of eternal life. I entered God's kingdom (Colossians 1:13-14).That is the message of hope which is grievously missing from ""Unconditional."" Helping a stranger is noble. Feeding, clothing, and educating at-risk children is noble too and can bring about some positive change in the world, at least in the eyes of man. But from God's perspective, if the name of God's salvation, Jesus Christ, the Hope of all mankind, is never mentioned; all that happens is helped, fed, clothed, and educated people never learn the way of salvation and go to hell. If all we do as Christians is meet people's earthly, temporary needs, we have failed. If all we do is tell people that God loves them and will change their lives if they will accept His love, we have failed. We have failed them and God. Jesus Christ, God in the flesh, the exact representation of the Father (Hebrews 1:3), said, ""You must be born again"" (John 3:7). Does anyone have the right to change what God has decreed? No matter how moving it may be, is ""Unconditional"" a great film if it changes the good news of Jesus Christ? If it omits the good news of Jesus Christ? No. This film is hard for me to dislike because it has such potential. It could have been monumental in its impact for Christ and eternity. Instead, it falls short. Rather than leading people to eternal life, ""Unconditional"" deceives people and will likely comfort many with false hope, while they continue on a path toward hell. This is a lamentable summary of the film, but it is factual, and it is frighteningly common today.Given the quality of the film's production and the power of its messages (which will draw people into error), I advise against watching it due to the grievous omission of the saving gospel of Jesus Christ.",1.0,Another Missing Gospel,1385683200.0,"11 29, 2013"

I will caveat this assertion with my concern that durability may become an issue rather quickly, depending on use.As mentioned in the review title, I bought this &#34;Display Book&#34; with an alternate purpose in mind; to use as a sort of portfolio, to store, transport, and I was hoping, to be able to display 11x17 photo and digital art prints. Unfortunately, the easel doesn't stand well on its own when not completely full to facilitate balance, or if using different weights of card-stock or photo paper. The internal liner pockets are fairly thin and don't offer enough rigidity to provide adequate protection, when attempting to flip the pages, while utilizing thinner grade photo paper.Overall, the quality of the product is good (especially for the price), and many other reviewers have provided testimonials to its usefulness for presentations. I wanted to share my experience because, at the time of this review, there are not a large number of cost-effective options available for 11x17 photo/print display and storage.

A22Q3DG4CHS4JA,B002VKE0XA,"Jelly Jar ""Granny""","[12, 17]","I saw this in the wonderful Moolah Theatre in beautiful downtown St. Louis, MO. To start with, the awesome speaker system there did nothing for the terrible sound quality of the movie. They may have wanted it to sound more like the filming was being done by a camcorder, but gritty muffling throughout did nothing but detract from the entire experience.Another reviewer alluded to this movie as having the type of appeal that would attract eight-year-olds or those with eight-year-old intelligence levels (using much more degrading words, of course.) I wouldn't necessarily agree with that notion. On the contrary, the eight-year-olds and teenagers were the ones who were LAUGHING in the theater. NOBODY screamed until the last ten seconds.The bore factor here was incredible. Time crawled by while two shallow characters, Micah and what's-her-name, dealt with a supernatural entity that was never seen. Hey, it's okay to not show the demon; I understand that that's supposed to be part of the fear factor, but saving the best part of the movie for the extreme end when it could have been introduced as a foundation early on and then built upon for additional scares was a HUGE golden opportunity missed by everyone involved. But that's not all as far as missed opportunities go...the whole thing with the psychic, or whatever that character was supposed to be, was flawed and underdeveloped. That individual situation could have been expanded upon to create a whole different angle and level to the movie.So why all the hype, you ask? I have two theories. It may be one or the other, but its most likely a combination of both:1. Exceptional marketing, whether deceiving or not! 'Nuff said.2. When horror is presented in such a way that it is less about the grandiose, over-the-top, literally unbelievable, Hollywood presentation like ""Poltergeist,"" for instance, and more about something that is so subtle that it could actually happen to ""YOU,"" it opens the door for personal fears to creep through and subject the subconscious to a taste of a not-impossible reality.That being said, I give the movie and its makers three stars for effort, but keep in mind viewers, MOST of this movie is VERY boring.Three Stars ***",3.0,"Don't believe the hype!

It was written as a prediction of the future direction of American and western society - especially as regards the attitude to children and childhood but what comes across reading it 30 years later is a snapshot the late seventies.  As such this book can be little more than a curiosity now but what a curious one it is. The problem with making largescale predictions is that it is impossible to know what lies ahead.  Postman could not see, for example, Harry Potter, Japanese Manga, the internet, facebook or texting.  He could not have imagine the rise of China or a world where children's literature (books written for kids) was the most profitable sector of the global book market.Postman is a conservative and a reactionary who privileges a specific type of literacy (the reading of the right kinds of books) over other equally valid literacies.  Childhood under Postman's definition is not something that happened to kids in Africa or Asia or pre-colonial America and Australia it is a Europen phenomena tied to the fortunes of the printing press and therefore in great danger in our digital world.  What nonsense.  Childhood is much more robust than Postman gives it credit.  It also exists in many more places.The most compelling reason to read this book is in it Postman exposes the right wing origins of such contemporary phenomena as the Let Kids Be Kids movement and a conservative political scene which places the interests of Families over the interests of Citizens.  Postman's analysis of the dangers of TV and the early sexualisation of children has gone someway to dampen down my worries over these things.  I am less opposed to censorship now than I was before I read this book.  Childhood is a wonderful thing, and my own childhood was truly wonderful, but when it becomes the toll of idealogues or a prison for moulding a certain type of people then its day is done.",2.0,The kids are alright!,1317168000.0,"09 28, 2011"

As Luc Sante remarked, Sean Howe is to Marvel Comics what Procopius was the Byzantine Empire, which is apt considering the Byzantine creative processes at the company.  Marvel in its three major phases of development--early with Lee/Kirby, the middle years culminating in the Shooterverse, and the later years of boom/bust and resurrection as Marvel Films, are all covered in a loving, if bland, telling.  Maybe blandness is what passes for objectivity, as the history is told from different perspectives, and memories change over the years.While context and history are alluded to from time to time, like Marvel heroes and Vietnam, or the Comic Code Authority, a more general treatment of the company in publishing/media would have helped.  For example, we may know an issue was a blockbuster selling a couple hundred thousand copies, but how does that compare to other magazines, or rivals?  What about profit margins?  What about the economics of contracts, or reprints?  To be fair, many of these issues are touched upon, though anecdotally only, which is a source of charm, and a book thoroughly covering all these matters would have been immense.  As it is, this is clearly the work of a dedicated fan, and surveys the topics of concerns to fans, but necessarily limits the audience for the book somewhat for good or ill.The author has done a great job at this writing of continuing the journey of the book in social media like facebook, with updates, further or more elaborate anecdotes, and artwork--sort of like releasing a 'director's cut' over time of additional material and art, which is something that other books could do more to promote themselves and build their audience.The Untold Story is essential and recommended as a 'glimpse behind the curtain' for anybody who might have regarded themselves a fan of the Marvel Universe at any point in its history.",3.0,Telling the Untold Story,1355616000.0,"12 16, 2012"

If you are away for a week, it must run 24 hours a day for the entire week (unless you have someone there to manually unplug iTwin and put the machine to sleep for you). iTwin will not allow a computer to be put into sleep mode when it is plugged in and running.I had hoped to have a home computer automatically available to my son several hours each day for him to back his work up to while he is away at school. Easy to do by waking the machine from sleep mode at a certain time each day with a task set up in Windows Task Scheduler and then putting it back to sleep with a sleep setting in Windows Power Options (also requires a Power Options setting to Not require a password at wakeup.) As I said, easy to do. His home machine wakes up and goes back to sleep each day right on schedule UNLESS iTwin is plugged in. iTwin prevents the machine from going to sleep. I tried it on several different machines. Same result on every one. It did, however, allow all but one of the machines to wake up after I manually put them in sleep mode.I emailed iTwin helpdesk about this and basically they replied that iTwin is set up this way purposely because users don't remember to change their Power Settings to prevent their machines from going into sleep mode and then iTwin doesn't work for them. Further, they declined to consider giving users an option to disable the no sleep function. Apparantly they think we are idiots or just don't want to be bothered giving users options. Also, according to the reply I got from them, iTwin will prevent an automatic reboot if the machine gets an automatic update (for instance a Windows Security Update from Microsoft that requires a reboot) because a manual login is required at restart. Apparantly they don't think we are smart enough to set up our systems for automatic login - and again no consideration for any kind of a user option to disable.At the very least, iTwin's functionality is less than what it could be. If one only wants to use iTwin for short absences, it would be useful. However, for a longer absence, having a computer running contiuously just doesn't seem like a good idea to me. In addition, if a machine cannot make a necessary reboot for a security update, is it then left vulnerable to the object of that update?  It seems like that would defeat the purpose of automatic updates.Unfortunatly, Amazon's return period slipped away before I was able to try out the iTwin, so now it is mine.

A3M2KL2MMWHV3U,B0046M4H7K,Amazon Customer,"[1, 1]","For those of us who have been waiting for this Christmas album since we first heard Celtic Thunder; it is worth the wait!!  Each of the singers brings their own personalities to individual songs, like the power when you hear Paul sing Ava Maria or the fun Ryan has with Let It Snow, but the harmonies you have come to expect from Celtic Thunder shine through on the group numbers.  In my opinion, the version of Silent Night on the album is one of the best I have ever heard; Phil Coulter arrangement of the song is just amazing.  Neil makes a great addition to the group, brining another tenor in and allowing for even more complex harmonies than previously heard.  If you are a fan of Celtic Thunder, this album is one you need in your collection.  If you have never heard Celtic Thunder, this is an amazing album to start with.

The shoes do not have holes in them like most clogs of this style.  Not only does this make the shoes hotter because you don't get the air circulation of the others, but it allows for a certain suction to occur on your foot.  As you take a step, the suction is broken and a rather embrassing sound is emitted from the shoe as the air escapes around your foot.  The end result, it sounds like you are passing gas with every step!  I suppose if you only wear them in the garden this might be fine, but better hope nobody sneaks up on you!  I was also very disappointed in the comfort level of these shoes.  The insoles are quite hard feeling despite the fact that the shoes are extremely flexible.

AYCBX9P8SFKUH,1576733300,ruthlady,"[0, 0]","This work of fiction centers around four female friends of different ages. Naomi, Lucy, Rose and Gayle are in different stages of life and dealing with various circumstances and concerns. It is revealed in the story that the women have been friends for a long time and grew up in this small southern town.  Naomi feels that the four women have drifted apart and she thinks a `project' is just what they need to reconnect. An elderly woman named Grace is the project.This book is the second in a series, and I hadn't read the first book. Maybe that's why I didn't feel the women's characters were very well developed. There were times when I felt the interactions between the women were not believable. For instance, Naomi is referred to as the one who comes up with wild schemes and gets them all in trouble. In the case of Saving Grace the ""wild scheme"" is befriending the reclusive Grace Grayson-Wiley, inviting her to a children's play, and getting her back into society- GASP!The back story of the reclusive, elderly woman centers on an annual ball. When the woman was a young debutante her beau stood her up for the ball. Ever since then, she has dressed in the same ball gown and sat on her front porch on the anniversary of the ball. The details of their break up are not known, which is part of the mystery that surrounds her. The townspeople avoid her and refer to her as crazy. Maybe I just don't understand the southern culture, but I find this an exaggerated and extreme reaction to a quaint, slightly eccentric, yet otherwise normal, elderly lady.I just couldn't get attached to the women in this book. There were times when I felt like I was plowing through the pages; having said that, there is nothing objectionable about the content. Some older teen girls may enjoy the book, but I have reservations about how much they could relate to women with problems that include the worry of being an `old maid,' concerns of a husband wandering, romance after widowhood, and pregnancy at the age of forty.This is the kind of book I imagine as a good read on a vacation or road trip where intermittent reading could be enjoyed, as opposed to a riveting story where one cannot put the book down and a long uninterrupted weekend is called for.Note: I received this ebook from Multnomah Waterbrook Publishers in exchange for an honest review.",3.0,I could put this book down,1331596800.0,"03 13, 2012"

Going with the Cool Shaver a second time was an easy decision to make.However, the one problem I have is that liberating the shaver from the packaging was a major project.  It took a full ten minutes with fresh blade in my utility knife to complete the task.  Why is this necessary?  Is Norelco risking any liability in utilizing this packaging?

However, if you step up to the 30 plus dollar range (the price I paid), you step into another world of product.  Paying the extra you will get a concrete and noticeable difference in quality in and brightness.This light has 50 lumens at max brightness, 3 brightness levels, is waterproof, and just holding it, you can tell the quality of the product.  You simply don't get near this with a cheaper headlamp (I know, I own a few).

While O'Brien may have originally considered some of these takes inferior, to this listener there is no audible difference in musical quality whatsoever.  ""The Third Set"" is a highly enjoyable, swinging CD of bebop piano, with O'Brien backed superbly by bassist Ray Drummond and drummer Kenny Washington.The set opens with Howard McGhee's uptempo ""Double Talk"", and moves next  moves into a swinging  mid-tempo take of ""It Could Happen to You."" Then  O'Brien announces that ""We're going to do some Tadd Dameron now"", and leads the trio in no less than five Dameron compositions  including the well-known ""If You Could See Me Now"", the bluesy ""The Squirrel"", and the lesser known ""Dameronia."" As jazz buffs know, Dameron's compostions are quite beautiful, and  always provide fertile ground for swinging and inventive improvisation. Such is the case here. Dameron's music is meat and potatoes for this trio and brings out the best in all three musicians. O'Brien's stop-time segment in ""Our Delight"" will capture your attention and provide listening delight as it did for the audience at ""Blues Alley.""  The set and the evening ends gently with a reflective take of ""Easy Living.""Hod O'Brien is a master of bebop piano and on this 59 minute set gives us some of the most swinging, uplifting and satisfying modern jazz piano to be heard anywhere.

ANO3KSOXDYG2X,0066620694,Jennifer Ryan,"[30, 31]","Christensen clearly presents the reality of how disruptive technologies affect organizations. He reviews the business perspectives of large firms vs. those of small firms, and their issues with disruptive and sustaining  technologies, i.e., resources, profit margins, customers, etc. Christensen  explains that what to us, from the point of 20/20 hindsight, may now seem  like blatantly obvious organizational faux pas, at the time seemed like the  correct path for the organization to follow. He also reviews companies that  have been able to not only survive, but succeed with the emergence of  disruptive technologies.Disruptive Technologies vs. Sustaining  TechnologiesOne of the main reasons why great firms fail is that they  attempt to market and manage disruptive technologies utilizing the same  methodologies that are found to be successful for the management and  marketing of sustaining technologies. These firms are essentially held  captive by their customers, since this methodology is based on pleasing the  established customer base. Disruptive technologies often are intended for  different customer bases that may not have yet been discovered. Due to  this, disruptive technologies are often not seen as successful or  profitable by large firms that need to keep large profit margins. They are  instead seen as successful by smaller entrant organizations with smaller  profit margins.&quot;Resource Dependence - Customers effectively  control the patterns of resource allocation in well-run  companies&quot;Management, especially middle management, is very aware  of the customer base their company holds. Their customers are the ones who  keep pouring money back into their organization through the purchase of  products. These customers have set their expectation on the sustaining  technology the organization currently offers, as it helps them run their  business. They usually have little interest in a disruptive technology that  more than likely will not currently meet their needs. This, in turn, causes  any new projects involving disruptive technologies that are kept within the  same organization and held to the same profit expectations, which initially  they will no be able to meet, to not be held at the top of the  organizational priority list. The disruptive technology will be  &quot;shelved&quot; until it comes into the mainstream, and by that time it  may be too late.&quot;Small markets don't solve the growth needs of  large companies&quot;When a disruptive technology begins to make its  presence known, the disruptive technology needs to be viewed with serious  consideration. From this, proper planning for its many possibilities should  take place. These plans need to remain flexible, and development of the  disruptive technology should take place within a department, organization,  or subsidiary that has little financial bearing on the company as a whole.  This is the necessary environment for the successful development of a  disruptive technology. The larger organization can not expect this  disruptive technology to command the profit margins of the organization's  sustaining technologies until it has discovered its customer base.&quot;The ultimate uses or applications for disruptive technologies are  unknowable in advance. Failure is an intrinsic step toward  success.&quot;A great example from the book is the introduction of Honda  motorcycles in the U.S. in 1959. Initially Honda wanted to conquer the  American market with their 50cc Supercub bike, but their bikes weren't  built for running at high speeds for extended periods like Harley-Davidson  and BMW. Honda discovered, after failing to market the bikes as road bikes,  from actually watching how people used the bikes, that their bikes were  best suited for off road dirt biking, a sport that had not yet come to  fruition. Harley-Davidson attempted to take part of the new market, but  tried to do so by marketing this disruptive technology as a sustaining  technology. Their plan failed to prove profitable.&quot;Technology  supply may not equal market demand. The attributes that make disruptive  technologies unattractive in established markets often are the very ones  that constitute their greatest value in emerging markets.&quot;Honda was  able to do this by creating a new market segment, off road bikers! These  same bikes were not attractive to those customers interested in long haul  road bikes such as Harley-Davidson and BMW, but Honda's bikes now hold a  majority of the market.",4.0,Disruptive vs. Sustaining Technologies,947635200.0,"01 12, 2000"

A3NQSMTG612AF,0790733226,TheTruthHurts,"[9, 10]","Warning, this review contains spoilers...if you haven't yet watched it, don't continue on, but simply hear this; it is a masterpiece!  Forget renting it, find yourself a copy to own.This movie, at least as far as I am concerned, is Robert Zemeckis' best, even better than Back to the Future and Forrest Gump.  Let me begin by stating that if your IQ is lower than 100 (or 120 for that matter), you probably won't enjoy it.  Why?  There are indeed no ""aliens"" or ""monsters"" that jump out of the shadows, nor are there big men with big guns that blow them up and cheer ""go back to your home planet, you scum...America rules!!!""  This isn't Star Trek, nor is it your typical cornball ""sci-fi"" flick.  If it were, I wouldn't be reviewing it, because I wouldn't have seen it.  What this movie is is an amazing rendition of one of Carl Sagan's most enthralling and intelligent novels, and it is indeed a fine example of just how good a film based on a work of fiction can be.  What this piece is is a work of art; rather than stimulate our animalistic urges to see ""little green men"" pop out at us with ""plasma rifles,"" like most everything else that's come out of Hollywood since its inception, the ending of the film leaves it up to our imaginations, essentially, to decipher precisely what happened to Ellie (Dr. Elanaor Arroway, the protagonist) during her journey to the galaxy in which the star Vega is contained.  The beginning of this film alone, in which a three-plus minute digression from our planet through seemingly trillions of miles of the universe takes place, was enough to hook me.  This film is about not only the endless debate between religion and science, of which Ellie is a firm believer in the latter, but it is about her transformation, more or less, in the end of the film to someone just a little less skeptical...what Zemeckis (and obviously Sagan) was indeed trying to portray in the ending of this film is that there is reason to have ""faith"" in the future, even in these desolate times, and to show us that there just might be more than meets the eye to our existence...and that there may be more than we know, and/or are capable of knowing, to ourselves, our race, and each other and what each of us believes, especially in the face of having no tangible ""proof""...and finally that we are indeed never as ""alone"" as we all feel at one time or another.  A truly unique and masterful film, consistently underrated and panned by critics, most often for its inclusion of a certain ex-president in a couple video clips...give me a break.  Does that really detract from the quality and purpose of the film?  I think not, and to give the film lower marks for it is ludicrous, in my opinion.I am not a religious individual, and am in fact an agnostic.  I could easily envision overtly religious people loathing Jodie's character beginning with the scene of the death of her father, as she hastily denies the support of the religious figure(s) at her father's wake.  However, like I said earlier, the film is by no means out to deny the existence of God or debunk any religion, nor does it attempt to verify these concepts.  It is merely contrasting the two sides of the argument and makes valid points in favor of each.  So, my main point is that this film is so much more than a ""sci-fi"" film (to say that this film doesn't compare to Star Wars or Star Trek is quite absurd; they aren't even honestly in the same genre in the first place, and this film transcends any of that...stuff).  Just give it a chance, and if you disagree, so be it...but I know that it moved me like no other film had in quite some time, and I'm a better person for having seen it, and it remains one of my all-time favorite films, even eight years after its release.

So of course he thought it was getting to serious, so he faked his own death.Stole Beer From A Golfer-Earl has to put up with a golfer he took advantage of to get free beer by having him think he kept getting hole-in-ones. That made him obsessed with golf which lost him his job, dog, and girlfriend.

AK7CAW3N1XZV6,B003H8F43U,"Beth Cholette ""doctor_beth""","[11, 12]","NOTE:  I received a free review copy of this DVD from the web site Metapsychology Online; you can read a more complete copy of my review on that site.This DVD features Trudie Styler, wife of Sting, in a workout led by James D'Silva.  The setting for Pure Sculpt is Styler's and Sting's beautiful Tuscan villa; the workout segments are filmed either on an outdoor patio against gorgeous mountainous scenery or in a handsomely styled indoor marble area.  The music (as one might guess) is provided by Sting:  soft, instrumental selections from his Songs from the Labyrinth album.The basic design of this DVD is that there are six distinct workouts, each of approximately 10 minutes in length (actual times are below), which can be used either separately or together.  Sub-menus off the Main Menu allow you either to select individual workout chapters or to customize the chapters in any order.  The Main Menu of the DVD offers the following options:  Play All - Workouts - Custom Workout - Bonus Materials.  D'Silva instructs all of the routines via voiceover (note:  he does not mirror-cue) while both he and Styler perform the moves.  I have broken down each of the segments in detail below.Warm-Up (10 minutes)The majority of the warm-up is performed standing, with D'Silva strongly emphasizing cuing the breath as he leads a series of gentle, flowing stretches; towards the end of the warm-up, he moves to the floor for some brief work on all fours, down dog, and cobra.  Unfortunately, the music is a bit loud in this section, and because D'Silva is so soft-spoken, I sometimes had trouble hearing his instructions here.Core Conditioning Routine 1 (10 minutes)This floor segment is based on traditional crunch-type exercises, but D'Silva executes them in a slower, more deliberate pace throughout.  He includes both curl-ups and reverse crunches (hip raises), and he intersperses pelvic lifts, performed as a sort of stretch or rest in-between some of the other moves.  There are also some Pilates-like exercises, including leg circles and criss-cross.Core Conditioning Routine 2 (8.5 minutes)In this section, D'Silva incorporates even more Pilates-like moves, beginning with a variation on the Pilates roll-up in which he flows up and into a side stretch, first with the legs together, then with the legs apart.  This is followed by a version of the Pilates rollover/plow pose, made more advanced by keeping the arms overhead rather than by the sides for support.  D'Silva increases the difficulty level even further by instructing you to grab your ankles while in plow and roll forward; eventually, you are rolling from plow to a Pilates teaser position, a very advanced move.Lower Body Toning Routine 1 (12 minutes)For this segment, you will set up on the floor in a side-lying position and perform a series of movements emphasizing the hips/outer glutes.  D'Silva starts with a bent leg lift, but he moves through a long sequence of both bent and straight leg work, including tempo changes.  Influences of both the Pilates side kick series and ballet can be seen here.Lower Body Toning Routine 2 (12.5 minutes)This routine focuses more on the rear glutes.  D'Silva and Styler start in a face-down position, and D'Silva cues small pulsing movements, first with a single leg, then both legs.  Next comes about five minutes of leg lifts performed on hands and knees; you'll start with straight leg lifts, then move on to bent leg before switching to the other side.  For the final few minutes of this segment, D'Silva and Styler are in a kneeling position for side leg lifts.Pure Arms Routine 1 (9.5 minutes)In this segment, both Styler and D'Silva are wearing wrist weights.  D'Silva begins by warming up the shoulders with shoulder rolls and side delt raises.  He then continues with less traditional exercises (many have distinctive names such as ""waitress,"" ""engine,"" and ""disco arms""), keeping the arms in constant motion throughout the entire segment.Pure Arms Routine 2 (9.5 minutes)Styler and D'Silva are again wearing the wrist weights here, but Styler is also holding small dumbbells in her hands.  This segment is fairly similar to the one preceding it, and in fact it includes many of the same movements (e.g., waitress, engine arms).  However, you will also perform some more traditional upper body exercises, such as tricep extensions (although D'Silva cues these moves in a more flowing, continuous manner).I had a few problems with this DVD.  First, although there is a separate Warm-Up, there are no cool-down.  D'Silva does incorporate some stretches within each of the individual workout segments, but this is not sufficient.  The second issue is more significant.  I would rate the overall level of this DVD as being appropriate for low intermediate exercisers and above.  However, some of the exercises included in the second core segment are quite advanced--I consider myself to be a high intermediate exerciser, but I was reluctant to follow along for fear of injury.  No modifications are shown or suggested by D'Silva.This series of DVDs from Styler and D'Silva certainly has plenty of appeal--D'Silva is a competent, likable instructor, and both D'Silva and Styler are graceful and inspiring in their movements.  While Pure Sculpt offers some innovative and effective exercises, the difficulty level of some of the segments may limit its utility amongst home fitness enthusiasts; for this reason, my final rating is 3 1/2 stars.",4.0,"Mix & Match segments for Upper Body, Lower Body, and Core Work",1300060800.0,"03 14, 2011"

I have to change my cuff button from 2nd to 1st to leave room for it.  And it is definitely ""there"".  My last watch was a Casio a couple of mm thick and so it was almost not like wearing a watch, except the time was on my wrist.  I suspect I'll end up buying another one of those, but I'll give this one at least a couple of week's try to be fair.The setup and instructions are atrocious.  It's generic Timex, and it's not obvious which one this is.  Some have a two-position crown, some have a three-position crown.  After playing with the crown for a while, it seemed there were two positions.  But I couldn't change the date, except by spinning the dial forward 24 hours, which takes dozens of turns.  Imagine wanting to go forward a month.So I studied the watch under a bright light for a while until I found in 2-point font on the back a number, like a serial number, which was in fact the part number.  I went to the web, and from there deduced it actually was a 3-position crown.  So where was that third position?  Eventually I found it by very gently easing the crown out to the middle position.  It was easiest to do it with eyes closed, like picking a lock, to really feel the microscopic motion.  Even then it took a while to realize that the date could only be adjusted forward, not back.Since I had a reference clock to set the watch by, I know this  procedure took from 8:39 to 8:51, or 12 minutes.

They begin exchanging warm emails as she lives in Arizona.  He also considers coming out of retirement to work the California recall governor initiative though his memory of the odious Bushwhacking of the Cleland campaign in Georgia still leaves a bitter aftertaste.  However, first before he can regain his lost youth this Boomer needs to rid himself of Peg.This odd contemporary character study focuses on an aging eccentric boomer who lives comfortably, but regrets his major choices in life starting with Peg.  After meeting Valerie, he decides she is the person who will make the rest of his life worth living, but he understands he must rid himself of Peg.  An incredibly developed character somewhat at the expense of the overall plot, fans will not like George, but will empathize with his disappointments in himself that he manifests with his anxiety attacks and his projection of blaming Peg.

A23G50BB2EAJ99,0736924965,Editors at Lighthouse Trails Research Project,"[13, 48]","In the pages of Death by Church: Rescuing Jesus from His Followers, Recapturing God's Hope for His People (Harvest House, 2009), author Mike Erre (pastor of RockHarbor Church in Costa Mesa, California) acknowledges that Jesus is Lord. He also references a number of Scriptures and talks about several different Bible stories. But for the discerning Christian who knows his Bible, it doesn't take too long into Erre's book to realize something is amiss, and such a reader soon begins to have a sense that he is theologically being tossed to and fro between the pages of this book and soon feeling like he is in a battle zone for the truth. Sandwiched between the Scripture references and the mention of ""Jesus"" is a theology that does not at all represent the Gospel.Death by Church has a point to make--that God is saving ""all of creation"" (eg. p. 100) and that the ""church"" is not the substance of the kingdom of God (i.e., the whole of creation and all of humanity is). In fact, Erre says, the church is not the kingdom of God at all - it only points to the kingdom of God, which incorporates all of creation and, if the church does all the right things it can have the privilege of being part of that kingdom too. Erre seeks to prove his point but not just by turning to Scripture - he turns to prominent figures in the emerging/emergent church (those such as Brian McLaren and Dan Kimball), the contemplative mystical prayer movement (those such as Dallas Willard and panentheist Richard Rohr-a favorite of Erre's), and New Age sympathizers (those such as Marcus Borg, who believes Jesus did not see himself as the Son of God and Gregory Boyd, author of the not-yet published work, The Cosmic Dance). Couple Erre's frequent use of emerging/contemplative/New Age sympathizing authors with his kingdom-now theology wrapped in universalist/panentheistic overtones, and Death by Church actually takes on a pseudo-name, Death by Deception.",1.0,Death by Church a Great Deception,1243382400.0,"05 27, 2009"

A1K3YQH371UADK,B0028Y5SBM,Jimmy L.,"[3, 3]","This set is Part Two of the 12-part ""Secret Wars"" series.  Each set comes with a reprint of one of the twelve ""Secret Wars"" comic books and two action figures of characters featured in the comics.  The series celebrates the 70th anniversary of Marvel Comics and the 25th anniversary of the ""Secret Wars"" storyline, which saw superheroes from throughout the Marvel universe team up to fight the supervillains.  Spider-Man, the X-Men, the Fantastic Four, the Avengers, etc., all in one story.Issue #2 comes with figures of the Human Torch and Wolverine.  The figures are much like the other recent figures in Hasbro's 3-3/4"" scale Marvel Universe line.  They are highly articulated, given their small size, with all the joints the other Marvel Universe figures have.  This makes them posable, but less durable.  Young children who play hard with their toys may have arms and legs falling off of these figures, especially the relatively frail Human Torch figure.The highlight of this set for me is the Human Torch, who is shown the way I always remember him: red and covered in flames.  The figure is red from head to toe, with some yellow flames added to his head and yellow flame designs painted on his body.  It's much better, in my opinion, than the other Human Torch figures out there, where it's Johnny Storm in his Fantastic Four uniform, only his hair is on fire.  I never liked that look.  Anyway, the figure feels rather delicate and comes with a flame accessory that attaches to its hand.The Wolverine figure comes in his '80s-era brown & orange (tan?) costume.  It's an entirely different figure than the similar retro-costumed figure from the X-MEN ORIGINS: WOLVERINE movie line.  This figure is actually bigger and has a completely different sculpt.  The movie figure had a wider mask and an ugly grimace on its face.  Its belt buckle had an ""X"" for ""X-Men"".  And the costume was a much darker orangy color.  This ""Secret Wars"" version has a simple stoic expression on its face and a traditional belt buckle.  The costume is more yellowy in color, and the brown is redder.  Wolverine's claws are attached to his hands, but made out of a rubberier plastic, so they might bend, but they shouldn't be dangerous.The comic book included is printed on a glossy magazine-type paper (as opposed to traditional ""comic book paper"") in full color, but the comics are usually bent out of shape inside the packaging.The Marvel Universe line is great because characters from throughout the Marvel mythos are available in simple 3-3/4"" figures designed from their well-known comic book appearances.  In the case of these ""Secret Wars"" figures, they are designed from their looks in the comic books included with them.  These 2-figure, 1-comic sets are nice for collectors.  Kids can enjoy them, too, and educate themselves on their heroes' past exploits.  But I have a feeling these toys wouldn't be as much ""fun"" as other products out there.  This is a good set, though, if you want the retro looks of the Human Torch and Wolverine.I was never a big comic book aficionado, but the ""Secret Wars"" series was a big deal in the Marvel universe.  Now a new generation can enjoy these classic stories and collect their favorite classic superheroes.",4.0,"Part Two of ""Secret Wars"" series; good for collectors",1256688000.0,"10 28, 2009"
AQKKK3WHCHJA1,B000001I0Q,T.B.,"[2, 2]","This is a review of the most recent (2013) CD release from &#34;Real Gone Music&#34; of The Lords Of The New Church's self titled debut album from 1982.First, a short bit about the album itself - This album was The Lords first album and is one of those rare debuts from an early 80's rock band that is a solid, great listen from start to finish.  Featuring former Dead Boys front man Stiv Bator, original Damned guitarist Brian James, bass player Dave Tregunna and Nicky Turner on drums - this band was pretty much the ultimate punk supergroup.The Lords debut album sound still remains fairly unique, especially the way the album was mixed with heavy reverb and compression that gives many tracks a sort of gothic surf guitar vibe.  Like a few other great punk bands that (at least appeared to be) in it for the long haul like The Clash, The Lords took the simple, raw hate stare of punk and refined and matured that sound and style without losing the genre's basic appeal.  They touch on many influences, from The New York Dolls to Jim Morrison to Apocalypse Now backed by the tribal, Killing Joke-esque drumming of Turner, the clear, clean bass of Tregunna and James' chiming, sharp guitar.  Fronted by Bator's snarling, acerbic vox, as said in Scott Schinder's essay on the band in the booklet, this is the band's defining statement.The minor downside of this release is there's no extra tracks such as relevant B-sides (Young Dont Cry, Girls Girls Girls) or the pre-album single versions of Livin' On Livin' and New Church included.  The 2003 Track Records release at least included the two B-Sides.Otherwise, this release sounds very much like the older Track Records remaster, however the big plus is the new liner notes and graphic layout of the booklet which includes several images of the various 7&#34; single sleeves and a few nice photos of the band from the era the album was recorded.  Like the other 2 Real Gone Music reissues, the tray graphic includes the alternate UK album cover.If you are a first time buyer of this or the other 2 Lords albums newly released by Real Gone Music, I highly recommend all three albums and this one is the by far the best of their studio releases.  I give this one my highest score because it is a genuine classic of the genre despite the fact it is a no frills release.  This one will appeal most to those listeners interested in the old school Damned/Goth/Punk style that the band members came from.",5.0,2013 Reissue of Classic Lords Debut Album,1385078400.0,"11 22, 2013"

A2UBS120XE605X,B00005V63C,Frank Paris,"[2, 2]","It can be terrifying installing new hardware and drivers on a PC and it was for me with the Yamaha CRW3200FXZ, but the terror was short-lived and it seems to be behaving itself. I bought this drive because the specs seemed to be superior to drives that have even faster write rates (up to 40X -- this one is 24X). I'd heard that 24X drives can achieve writing a full 700 MByte disk in 5 minutes. Well this one does it in 4 and for that it is worth five stars for me, but a few nits and my ""terrifying"" experience with it cause me to downgrade it to four stars.First, the terrifying experience, caused by a bug in the driver. The enclosed Firewire cable that comes with the unit is a mere 27 inches long (pretty useless), so I had set it up on the floor (the only place it would reach the back of my PC). Then I cut 11 700 MByte disks (all different) without a hitch, and I was surprised and extremely delighted by the 4 minute burn time for each disk. My previous CD burner was SCSI and rated 12X yet it took a half hour to burn each disk (albeit on a slower machine). So I couldn't be happier about this speed, the very reason I bought this to begin with.Then I went out and bought a six foot Firewire cable and had to disconnect everything to re-position the unit. To my annoyance, the unit did NOT automatically reconnect like Firewire devices are supposed to. So I rebooted my machine without plugging in the Firewire cable and as soon as the CRW3200FXZ driver announced its presence, to my horror, Windows 2000 crashed with the infamous blue-screen! I rebooted twice more and got the same blue screen crash. Out of desperation, before my fourth attempt, I hooked up all cables and rebooted again. To my great relief, everything booted up properly and the unit was once again fully functional. Now I'm afraid to turn it off! But the driver packaged with my unit was obviously buggy, which is one reason I downgraded my rating from 5 to 4 stars. I haven't yet checked the Yamaha website to see if there is an update.A nit that I have with the packaging is the outrageously bright LED sitting on the front of the unit. You know those exceedingly bright LEDs that have been recently developed that they now put in headlamps and flashlights? Yamaha is using one of those on the front of their device! It's so bright when a disk is not in the unit (a bright violet) that you can't even look at it and it puts a purple glow in my entire bedroom at night! With a disk in place a not quite so bright (but still too bright) blue light emanates from that same LED. Yamaha should have used a standard LED, which is all you need.The burn software that comes with the Yamaha for free I like better than the best-selling commercial product. I have just two complaints. To start a new job, you have to go through a wizard every time which requires four quick clicks of the mouse to run through it. Fortunately it remembers all its settings from one execution to the next, so it is only a minor complaint. What is superior about this software is the progress status it gives while writing the disk: everything you would want and more. The only thing I don't like about it (besides the wizard) is that it doesn't give you the exact byte count on the main dialog when you prepare the job. You have to go fishing for it inside the menu system. I had one disk that was right on the border of 700 MBytes (according to the progress bar) but I decided to let it rip anyhow. After grinding away for four minutes, it gave me an error indicating that the disk was unwritable! So I tried again and got the same thing. I decided to test this one and saw that I could read everything on the disk. Apparently there wasn't enough room on the disk to write some terminating status or something. But the disk was good!So some minor complaints and a few minutes of terror. Other than that, the unit seems to be well designed (except get rid of the torch of an LED!) and it's blazing fast for its 24X rating.",4.0,"Great intrinsic design and fast, but had scary problems",1033171200.0,"09 28, 2002"

After reviewing book 1 in this series I fell in love with the characters and was eagerly anticipating the next story.Chloe and Scotty fit perfectly together, these two characters are written so that as a reader we feel we&#8217;re on a journey with them. The fact that I am so drawn not only to the characters but also the game of Baseball has truly surprised me.Pamela Aares has a wonderful way in her writing of making the reader look at certain things in a whole new way.

A18TSDA9ZRLKVM,B00269DX5W,"Robert S. ""geek hipster""","[11, 17]","The first Assassins Creed is notorious in it's reputation. Alot of people felt it was a nice tech demo for graphics, but otherwise it just a platformer game with a few simple objectives that went on way too long.  I agreed, but still enjoyed it, and was curious to get through to the end to find out where the story was going.I was a mollified to see that in the interest of making a larger game, the graphics in 2 have been simplified to run more smoothly. AC2 is full of blurred edges and textures and a muddy color palette. The shadows are blocky, and don't move realistically (especially on faces in some closeups). Character models show some weird artifacts. Distances are flattened in a perpetual haze. One thing I really loved about AC1 was how you could stop and look at any street and appreciate all the fine detail. Not so here.  There ARE more people types in the street in AC2, but otherwise this is a graphical downgrade that seems to want to conjure up comparisons to an oil paint 'look'. AC1 may have had hiccups and slowdown, but it 'popped' and looked alot cleaner on my hi-def TV than this.The gameplay... might be a matter of taste.  If you wanted more step & fetch, this game has it.  You'll do alot more running back and forth, getting letters, documents, delivering boxes, carrying bodies, beating up philandering boyfriends, following people, etc. Having to manually follow someone who you are having a conversation with was a little weird. There is also the addition of an ingame economy, so you can now rob dead people, pickpocket, buy paintings, change the color of your clothing, repair your armor and weapons, hire prostitutes to lure guards (fun!), throw money in the street to draw a crowd... Point to point races against local couriers will challenge your ability to find the quickest route across the rooftops and pray Ezio doesn't 'stick' to the wrong surface. Simple Puzzle segments scattered throughout the game world will illuminate more of the games backstory.  A notoriety 'system' will force you to remove wanted posters (never on the street, always on second story balconies, for some reason) and kill local police. Visit Leonardo Da Vinci who will create weaponry for you if you have the right design sketches and later unlock a nice flying mission...The core experience of the game hasn't changed at all, though. The running over rooftops is still a breeze (unless you're on a clock), and the combat is workable and fun, though the context sensitive scheme will occasionally frustrate, BUT - just like AC1, you don't ever get to perform a stealth kill on any of the games main-story targets... you track them, listen to a speech, run them down, run them through in front of a huge crowd, and then run like hell as dozens of screaming guards chase after you. It's hardly stealthy and you've done this already.The story? You're the lusty son of a proud nobleman, wronged by a conspiracy involving the Assassins and the Templars, and nothing is what it seems bla bla bla etc... I will give that Ezio is a little more likable than Alta'ir of the first game.. but it didn't make me care about him or his family, or what was going on, and Desmond simply switching teams to be exploited by Lucy and her friends instead of the evil Abstergo Company  didn't impress me much, either. I thought Desmond was a dullard in the first game, but the Holy Land story was more crackling than this.  AC2's story gets lost in the volume of chores you have to do very quickly.If you didn't like the first game, there's no way I would recommend this.",2.0,"Surprisingly, No Taxi Missions",1259366400.0,"11 28, 2009"
A2UN4S3N7VYLEV,0099740915,Charles E. Stevens,"[1, 1]","This was my first experience with Margaret Atwood, and based on my enjoyment of this book it will not be my last.  The pacing was deliberate, thoughtful, and yet still suspenseful in a way that reminded me of Ursula Le Guin; the oppressive, big brother, totalitarian aspect reminded me quite a bit of George Orwell.  Those are two of my favorite authors, so perhaps it is no surprise that this book worked for me.It was interesting to read that Atwood says she writes ""speculative fiction"" rather than ""science fiction"", a distinction I call interesting because it calls to mind Le Guin's excellent introduction to her novel ""Left Hand of Darkness"" where she states (correctly, I believe) that (good) science fiction is descriptive, not speculative.  In other words, no one has a crystal ball, and trying to guess what the world will be like tomorrow let alone a decade, century, or millennium from now is not the job of a fiction writer.  While there are, by necessity, speculative elements in any science fiction work, the main goal of the author is to use that setting to tell a story about events happening now.  In other words, while a science fiction story might contain monsters and spaceships, it is not *about* monsters and spaceships.  To me, this is where The Handmaid's Tale shines ... not necessarily a predictor of what the world (or the U.S. specifically) will be like in the near future, but rather as a metaphor for important current issues such as gender relations, age relations, tying the value of women to marriage and children, the objectification of historical events and individuals (I'm thinking of the epilogue), religion, voice vs. silence, etc., etc. ... issues no less important today than when Atwood penned this tale thirty years ago.  Some of these issues have become much more subtle and implicit than in the '80s in the U.S. and Canada, and remain much more explicit and overt elsewhere, but are universally important (and will likely remain so for centuries to come).I loved Atwood's writing style as well.  I've seen words such as ""slow"" and ""confusing"" used to describe this book in some of the less favorable reviews here, but I think for someone who takes the time to truly read and think about the tale this will not be the case.  The blending of past and present, the paranoia and moments close to madness, this is all what one would expect from a prisoner trapped in an Orwellian universe.  I liked how there is a slow reveal of the world the protagonist is forced to live in ... the book becomes all the more chilling and suspenseful--and thought-provoking--the more details are filled in.Obviously not for everyone, but for me I thought this was an outstanding read.  If you're looking for light reading or an action-driven story, this is not the book for you.

The first design mistake I noticed was that they moved all of the attachments to the bottom back! Terrible idea! You have to bend to remove and replace the attachments every time you use them. The previous design had them under a plastic lid in the top front where they were readily accessible. For me this was a better design as I never used the (useless) brush attachment that they have mounted in the top front now. Suction is good for pet hair and small crumbs but this vaccuum is terrible at sucking up small things like cheerios or mini-M&M's. You literally have to go over them 10 times before they get sucked up. The other disappointing thing about this model is how cheap the tubes are.

The 11 tracks are mostly Rock & Roll raveups, with catchy sing along choruses that stick in your head.  Their last album, the excellent ""Brothers"" combined this approach along with soulful ballads and midtempo tracks.  This time around they are aiming for the rafters with a consise and focused album, which is also their most commercial album to date.  But this is not a bad thing, as they have not sacrificed any of the clever lyrics and great melodies that have put them at the forefront of current Rock & Roll.  The soul influence is also firmly intact with the 'Motown meets Spector' Danger Mouse touch on songs like ""Dead & Gone"" and ""Sister"", and the classic ""Stop Stop"".  Songs like these balance the albums anthemic ravers. The Rock & Roll ravers are the real meat and heart of this great album.  ""Lonely Boy"", ""Money Maker"" and especially ""Gold On The Ceiling"" are lighter-raising classics of the highest order.  I mean, how many bands are making Rock & Roll party records like this anymore?Producer Danger Mouse has managed to keep the grit and edge on this record.  My only complaint (and it's minor) is he murks up Dan Auerbach's vocals on too many tracks.  What he does do brillantly is coax many tones and shades from Dan's guitar. Patrick Carney's drums are at times snappy, then thunderingly loud, but solid as rock throughout.  I think Danger Mouse is looking to create his own Wall Of Sound, and The Keys are the perfect band to realise this vision with.  Hopefully their collaboration will continue.The vinyl pressing is excellent, and the inclusion of the CD is very nice.  Like their last album, it comes with a cool poster.

Always leave your shoes on.&#8221;&#8230;and that&#8217;s just the beginning of how hot this story gets.Stephanie Bradford is thriving in her career, but life at home with her husband, Jacob, has grown stale. Her attempts to reignite the spark have failed. Her frustration is at an all time high when the charming, dynamic, and sexy-as-hell Derrick enters her life. He offers her all she&#8217;s been craving from her husband....desire, passion, kink. Stephanie gives into temptation, taking her life out of control on a twisted path full of passion, betrayal, tragedy, and mystery.I think a lot of readers can relate to the way Stephanie feels in the beginning of this book. Bryan paints a picture of challenges many face in their marriages. People get comfortable, fall into routines, and although the love remains, the fire fades. Stephanie longs to feel sexy and desirable; she wants the excitement, the heat, and the lust. Her encounter with Derrick incites all of those feelings in her. It&#8217;s when Stephanie acts on those feelings that the story takes us on an unpredictable journey.I loved the unpredictability of the plot. I find myself saying this a lot, but I am thrilled when a book surprises me. Bryan reminds us that you never know what a person is capable of&#8230;how much a person can love another or what sinister tendencies someone has hidden inside.

Hilarity and chaotic/exciting moments ensue...Generally speaking it's a fun book to read if you're a fan of the vampire/supernatural genre. There are a few technical problems here and there but as long as you try not to take those things too seriously and you'll be fine.For example, there are places where there exists large, multi-paragraph descriptions, devoted to the observation of a single thing. All the while, the characters do nothing but stare blankly at said thing.  To those of you who have watched the TV show ""The Wonder Years"", you know what I'm talking about. There were occasions when characters stared blankly at objects and said nothing. They just kept thinking their inner monologue. Personally, there were times I imagined how weird that looked, to stand in a room where two main characters just stare at each other for an extended length of time, and have nothing happen. Just looking... and looking... and looking... But, that's just me. You can skim those paragraphs if they get too long, and you'll still be ok.This story works fine as a stand alone book.

In this book though, I never felt like there were any obligatory cameos at all. The book's female protagonist did have a large family (The Argeneau Family), the members of which, I asume, are each the subject of their own books in the line. They all had different personalities, but since they had the same goal, in the end, memorizing every name and motivation wasn't an issue, so I never felt lost or confused.There's a vampire hunter sub-plot. It was ok. It did what it had to, and didn't get in the way of the romance, the latter, of course, being the important bit.There was one rather large large plot that never gets resolved at the end, which kind of bothered me. The author did that thing where the book simply goes: It will get resolved in the future, even though you don't read about it here, or anywhere else, it will get resolved, trust me. The end.That being said, as long as you read this book as the tale of a kind hearted vampire with issues and a psychiatrist who finds himself falling for her, you'll be fine.

There was still that air of paranormal, but it was focused more on the love, the past, and the reuniting of two people.

I think the author did an amazing job pulling at the reader's heart, allowing them to fully enter into the character's lives.  I felt terrible for Jack and Sarah, and the love that was not allowed to bloom.  But there is a certain comfort that comes at the end, so there is that.Great job!

As a result, this album was poorly promoted by the record label, whose corporate officers were engaged in a boardroom war to choose a leader of the company that did not end until mid-1994. The label from 1991-1993 was chaired by Bob Krasnow, Anita Baker, and Natalie Cole, thus making the label very chaotic. When a final leader, Sylvia Rhone, was chosen, she set out to remove all 80's bands from the label by bankrupting them, thus hurting Malmsteen's career.[citation needed]The album was to be Malmsteen's last major commercial outing. It was his third and last attempt (starting with 1988's Odyssey on Polydor) at scoring a hit album with late 80's/early 90's American glam metal audience. The album, apart from the song ""Teaser"", however, was more closely rooted in neo-classical metal than any album he'd done since 1986's Trilogy (also on Polydor). It featured three stunning neo-classical instrumentals, as well as several good neo-classical metal pieces. Being a more commercial album, it featured bright, clear production as well, which is still credited by fans to this day.I'm just experiencing a wave of nostalgia. I thought this album was way underrated.A great Yngwie album just like Wikepedia says.Also as a footnote, the early 90's became the era of grunge metal and all the 80's bands including Yngwie were just old hat - all of a sudden - grunge is all over the magazine covers but diehard fans don't forget. Point being that there's nothing wrong with Yngwie in the 90's - he was just off the fashion radar. Yngwie's fall from popularity wasn't due to the more ""commercial"" albums like ""Odyssey"" or ""Eclipse"" but to the rise of ""Grunge"" (the horror, the unspeakable horror).",5.0,Classic Yngwie Material,1291507200.0,"12 5, 2010"

It lets him view the activities of the unsuspecting person. He and Steph are also able to communicate mentally, and it is this unique, but secret talent which has helped them bring criminals to justice, as they assist the local sheriff when he asks for help.Unfortunately, there are other persons possessing this rare gift.Their sole purpose is to do evil and destroy everyone in their way, including Steph and Chris. The Campbells are also in debt, and have a very rich and powerful enemy, who will do anything devious to get them  to sell their farm.Kevin Hallock was in his element when he wrote Eye Spy.

I can now hook onto the bar with the hooks no matter what kind it is (olympic bars, machine bars, etc) and pull with my elbows to really get that back contraction in the upper to middle of my back without having to worry about my grip or letting my biceps do a lot or any of the work!! I can even hold it the squeeze for 2 seconds with my hands in a &#34;loose grip&#34; and that will get your back feeling like its on fire in all the places you want!!The HHooks are also well made as I put them through hell, every workout, plus the fit is good without cutting off circulation!! Another think I like about this product is the strap comes straight out not at an angle or from the side in like other wrist straps which to me makes the grip more secure without any stress felt on the wrists like the standard wrist straps.All in all, these Haulin Hooks are working better than even I expected and I would give them an A+ not just an A cuz my back in the 2.5 months I have been using these HHooks my back has grown thicker/wider than ever before.

Straps snuggly in place and narrow across the back for tearing through brush and occasional climbing without restricting movement. The back padding and shoulder straps keeps it comfortably worn even after a long hike day. The straps allow it to be removed and put on and snugged down quickly and easily. It's a well thought out design with only a few modifications I would upgrade. I'm not sure what moisture the Vapel mesh Airflow padded back wicks away, not where it wicks it to. But after a long hot hike, the  back of my shirt is excessively, dripping wet. On the contrary, It almost  seems to restrict air flow and retain moisture. I did get the Black one, so perhaps that contributes to the retention. And, I don't hike, not to sweat. The function of the air flow feature seem to be geared more toward Bike riders, when used at a more horizontal angle for air flow to be forced through.  I really like the idea of carrying two liters of nice iced water on demand. But again, I would modify a few features. Although the 2 liter water reservoir is easy to fill and clean, it is tricky to remove and install from and to its compartment. The holding snap opens hardly wide enough to accept the bag handle. The nice Black insulated foam tube sheathing might come in handy for preventing water delivery from freezing, but on hot days in can really heat up the first flow of water. Maybe if it were able to be removed and replaced? Also, the hands free- bite to activate nozzle is a bit to get used to. If slightly damaged in an attempt to function, it drips a very cool stream of water down your warmed up body. The nozzle did come with a temporary cellophane cover to keep it clean during shipping. But I have installed a pop on cap. I noticed other hikers dragging their exposed nozzle across anything and everything we came across from dust to poison oak. Nothing of which I'd prefer in my mouth.

I cut the ends of the cable off and directly wired the cable strands to the ethernet jack. Surprise surprise, this cable is cheap. But, that's pretty much what I expected for only 8 bucks.1) Not twisted pair cable, which means this isn't 'real' cat 5e...2) The gauges of the individual wires inside the cable were different. The Black wire was the biggest, the striped blue/green strands were significantly smaller diameter.3) As a result of (2), several strand colors did not work with punch-down ethernet jacks. The punch-down keystone wall jack has little blades that are supposed to cut through the wire insulation and make electrical contact with the wire. Well, some of the strand wires were too thin for the punch to cut through, and they ended up just mashing the insulation. I had to strip those wire strands and solder it directly to the jack.So, as a patch cable (i.e. plugging it in on both ends), this cable performs as expected. If you try to do more than that (like I did), you're in for a world of headaches. I won't hold the cable accountable for my problems (because I went beyond what this cable was meant to do), but minus a star for not being twisted-pair cat 5e. All cat 5 cable should be twisted pair.

Yes, I realize that they want this usable by both right- and left-handed people, but I have used other ambidextrous scissors that are much better.Details: I can fit only two fingers comfortably inside the handles.  If I use my index and middle fingers, the extremely poor fit of the other handle to the thumb is not just uncomfortable, but severely limits how far I can open the blades and how much cutting force I can generate with a natural motion.What I have settled on is having the middle and ring fingers inside the handle.  It seems _very_ strange having the index finger in front of the handle, but it allows adequate motion of the blades and allows me to generate enough force to cut medium chicken bones.With this grip, my little finger does not quite fit inside the handle, but having it outside puts too much space between it and the ring finger and thus feels ""unnatural"".

His extended family has gathered to pay their last respects while the media also arrives seeking a story especially since his two famous sisters have publicly feuded over him in the past fifteen years.The gathering is mindful of a similar family meeting that happened a decade and a half earlier to discuss how to handle the scandal.  On the front page of the newspaper is an accusation that Henry is having an affair with his parishioner Elizabeth Tilton witnessed by her children.  A church committee conducts a kangaroo hearing into the matter and in 1875, he stands trial for committing adultery while his former parishioner, Theodore Tilton, sues him.  Henry's sisters split as Harriet the renowned author supports him and Isabelle the ardent suffragette condemns her sibling.This is a fabulous historical fiction tale that could be easily read in the headlines of today.  Other flashbacks round out the tale, but it is the deftly handled celebrity trial of Henry Ward Beecher that makes this worth reading.

This book appeals to a wide variety of readers, it is written in way that doesn't scare off newbies, but manages to have enough meat for experienced Linux users. The great thing about this book is it spends a fair amount of time explaining how to do things on a variety of distros.Parts of the book that stand out in my mind are the chapters dealing with kernel recompilation, scripting and security. The kernel recompilation chapter is by far the best material I've seen on the subject to date, it almost makes kernel recompilation sound too easy. The security chapter is good starting point for sysadmins that are new to Linux. The book also provides a nice little introduction to scripting, although if your going to be a Linux sysadmin, the Orielly books on bash and perl are a must.There were very few things that I didn't like about this book. One thing that stands out in my mind is the author's insistence on using paper journal books for logging system changes. With the proper backup procedures in place, a web based system log is a much more efficient way of keeping tracking of changes. Overall, the book is must read for anyone new to Linux and is also a good pickup for seasoned Linux users.

Gomez,"[2, 2]","I don't know if it's just the one that I have but I am a semi-pro photographer who bought this and never really used it until I was in a bind where my other bag was being used by a friend so I pulled out this one. For the price, it's not bad I guess but I was disappointed in what happened after 1 day of use. Basically I took this bag with me to the Zoo where I was photographing a child's birthday party. I had a few lenses in there and my Canon 5d mark III which I primarily carried myself because I was shooting so much. This bag was by no means overfilled with gear. I had 2 other lenses and a flash. Other than that I had a few CF memory cards and batteries and that's it. Long story short, I used it for about 6 hours and before this day, I had NEVER used it before. This bag was on my back the entire time. It did not get dropped, snagged or scuffed on anything. A zipper did come off by itself during the middle of the day but that didn't really bother me because I knew that at the $30-$40 price point, they wouldn't be using high quality zippers.Long story short, I got home and sat my bag down and noticed a huge tear in both front end pockets. FAIL!!! Keep in mind I only used it once and for 6 hours tops. I was very disappointed that it ripped so easily. I could understand if I was packing a whole bunch of gear but I had a 24-70, 16-35 and a 50mm in the bag with a few CF cards and batteries. That's it. No tripod and I carried my 5D Mark III on me. Other than the breaking zipper and the tears, this bag does have a few slight design flaws that Canon could improve on. The first being that at the top of the bag, there isn't enough felt for the velcro to attach to which makes it difficult to rearrange this bag to keep everything safe and well cushioned. The bag could use more cushion while I'm on that subject but again, it's such a cheap bag you can't really expect Grade A materials. I gave it 2 stars because the cheap price point saves it from getting 1 star. I'll stick with my Think Tank bag from now on.",2.0,You get what you pay for,1346630400.0,"09 3, 2012"

The Jack Elliott/Victor Young ballad, ""Weaver of Dreams"" features some tender horn work from Hubbard while the Wayner Shorter-penned ""Marie Antoinette"" is a quirky, bouncy, mid-tempo showcase for the soloists.Tyner, drummer Elvin Jones and bass player Art Davis were in the midst of their tenure with Coltrane when this album was made and they display a deep simpatico throughout.

Despite great reviews on several legit treadmill rating sites, I almost didn't order b/c of some scathing reviews on Amazon about delivery & customer service.  BTW, I have no invested interest in Smooth or any other treadmill company.  I'm in academics.  Anyhow, I ordered on Wed. or Thursday of last week & it arrived Monday.  Had I been home, I could have had it on Saturday.  I had free shipping to the front door & the 2 guys they sent were great.  The treadmill came in 2 boxes; one big, but light.  The other was so ridiculously heavy I couldn't manage to budge it at all, and I'm a fairly strong woman.  Fortunately, my son has a buddy in the moving business.  He & his brother got it downstairs. Unbox it first.  You can separate out some parts & reduce both weight & dimensions.  Unless you have access to at least 2 really strong men, pay for the room delivery.  The delivery men did tell me that the ""white glove"" service (delivery to room & set up) is a waste of money.  They are only alloted 1/2 hr, which is often not enough.  Then you pay an hourly rate or they leave. He also said that they deliver numerous treadmills of all kinds every day & they don't really have any expertise in setting up any one model.  I think his exact words were ""we don't know what we are doing"".  That said, my husband & I set it up easily last night.  I'll echo a previous reviewer & state that it's crucial you 1) don't pinch the wires going through the right post and 2) HAND TIGHTEN ONLY the screws during the initial set up.  You get a chance to tighten them all later.  I works best to get all the screws in, tightened just enough to keep them from falling out.  GENTLY jiggle the console (you need 2 to put it on, but it's not heavy)to get the screws started.  They strip easily, so don't force anything.  Once all are in, tighten each one a little at a time, then go around & tighten a little more.  Repeat until they are all fully hand tight. The treadmill is nice, although I wish it had an internal fan. The decals are a little cheesy (very clearly decals)but that's just cosmetic.

AOEAD7DPLZE53,B004JISIE4,NLee the Engineer,"[73, 73]","I purchased thisSandisk 32GB MicroSDHC Class 4  Memory Cardover one month ago, for use in myVIZIO 8-Inch Tablet VTAB1008. At the same time, I also purchased a higher-pricedPNY 32 GB microSDHC Card (P-SDU32G10-EFS2)which is supposed to be a 'class-10'. My benchmark results, however, show that the Sandisk class-4 card is actually faster - most of the time.I used two sets of benchmark programs. One is called 'Flash Memory Toolkit v2.0', which measures the random read/write speed of files between 1MB and 15MB. The other one is called 'H2testw v1.4', which measures the sequential read/write speed using 1GB files. Here are my results: (see my uploaded charts in 'Customer Images' section for details)- For smaller files (1-5MB), the Sandisk class-4 card gives an amazing write speed of 15-17MB/s, while the PNY 'class-10' card can only get 1-6MB/s- For larger files (10-15MB), the Sandisk and PNY cards are about equal at around 8MB/s for write- For huge files (1GB), the PNY did better at 9.5MB/S, while the Sandisk dropped to 5.5MB/s- The read speeds of both cards are equally high at around 18MB/S (this number may be limited by the maximum speed of my card reader used)What the above shows is that: When used in a typical digital camera (with file size 3-5MB), this Sandisk 'class-4' card is at least twice as fast as the PNY so-called 'class-10' card. But when used in a HD video camera (sequential writing of huge file), then the PNY card should perform better.For a card to be marketed as a 'class-10', it must maintain a MINIMUM write speed of 10MB/s. So by this definition, the PNY card does not qualify since it cannot even achieve a MAXIMUM write speed of 10MB/s. This Sandisk card, on the other hand, exceeds the requirement of 'class-4' by a huge margin.Sandisk seems to be the only flash memeory manufacturer that still gives honest, conservative speed class ratings. Any other manufacturers would have labeled this card a 'class-6' or even higher. As a matter of principle, I rather give my money to a company that promises less but delivers more, instead of to others that do the opposite.The only problem with this package is that: the includedSandisk MicroMate USB Card Reader (SDDR-121-GREY)does not work at all. I tested it with differet micro-SD/SDHC cards on three different computers. They all can recognize the drive, but not the memory card inside. Minus one star for that.[Update on Oct 26, 2013]It turns out that the Sandisk MicroMate USB card reader is working. I just need to push the microSDHC card in a little further, until I hear a 'click'. Its speed is typical for an USB 2.0 card reader. Added back one star.[Update Nov 19, 2013]The Sandisk card is still working fine after two years in my tablet. It should be noted that I have purchased dozens of CF/SD/microSD cards over the past decade, and only experienced ONE card failure (which was caused by an incompatable card reader). So I'm probably just more careful in handling memory cards. For example, I always make sure to discharge myself electrically before touching a card to avoid ESD zap, and use ""Safely Eject USB Device"" command to remove a card.",5.0,This Sandisk 'class-4' micro-SDHC card is faster than a PNY 'class-10',1321833600.0,"11 21, 2011"

I read it so much that I asked for (and received) an unabridged copy of it for Christmas in 1967.  I have read that book at least 15 times over the years since then.  I loved Alexander Dumas' other books, too--at least half a dozen of them.  This very love of the characters in ""The Count of Monte Cristo"" and appreciation of the author's other works is what made me wish that I had never heard of this book.  It soured my pleasure of his talents.  Less than 10% of the book is actually about Edmond Dantes or his private life after he left with Haydee.  The rest is the story of the ""republican"" or ""communist"" revolution that finally overthrew the French monarchy for good.  It's not just that it's juvenile in its presentation (and I like history), it strains to include Edmond as a player and gratuitously throws in a little to make you feel as if it actually is telling you about life after vengeance.  Much of the book consists of characters sitting around talking about what happened/is happening/will happen.  You aren't there.  I have a rule which I have broken only once: if I start a book, I finish it.  This would have been the second book that I broke that rule on if I hadn't been rooting for a some redeeming quality up to the very end.  This book stinks on ice.

A3GWYO69U107WB,1938499921,jmn89,"[2, 3]","I received a free copy of this book from the author through a Goodreads giveaway.I thought this book was okay, but not fantastic.  I'm not a fan of Christian fiction usually, it seems that in most Christian fiction the God aspect is so forced and stilted.  This is not the case in this story.  Though that was still a little heavy handed for my taste, it was not overpowering.I do love historical fiction, and the Revolutionary War is a subject that I find very interesting.  Cooper did an excellent job of describing what a battle (because the book only really covers the span of time of one battle) was like.  She did a good job of building up to the battle, and I did feel very &#34;in&#34; the story at times.  I also like that the book was inspired by real people, and that the house is still standing.The writing itself was fairly good.  It flowed well, and I could follow the story easily for the most part.  My complaint with the writing was that there was not enough development.  There were a couple of things that really bothered me throughout: Betsy has a brother and sister-in-law that are only loosely referred to, but are somewhat imperative to the story.  It took me quite a while to realize that Josiah's parents were not present.  Also, Amos is mentioned a few times, and he seems like he should be important to Betsy's state of mind, but there's never a real explanation of who he is or what happened to him, besides a very brief and unsatisfying sentence or two.  I personally felt that the characters could have been fleshed out some more.  I rarely say this, but I honestly feel that this book could have been better if it was longer.Overall, this book was a quick and easy read; good for people who enjoy historical Christian fiction.

Suspenseful right? We have plot twists that will have your head spinning! She also gives us two budding romance stories not just one, which I thought was very well done. We have two couples that play an important role in this story the main couple is Jax and Raven. The heat between them is scorching! He is a man that is used to getting what he wants no questions asked but finds himself chasing after the one person that has turned his life upside down. Raven is a woman with a past that has made allusive with a tendency to run when things get to close of to heavy, but Jax if having none of it.When Jax decides that they will be a couple Raven has no choice but to give into her desires and see where this will take them. Being in the spotlight becomes an issue when both of their pasts come to destroy what they are desperately trying to build. Now let's talk about the heat level this couple share. I do believe I said it was scorching and I mean blazing, scorching HOT! Jax has dominating tendencies and enacts them frequently taking raven to new heights. Try to be in a comfortable, cool spot as your are reading because Jax will have you squirming.Now the second budding romance that we have in this book is Jackie and Max. max is Jax's body guard and best friend, Jackie is best friends with Raven. When the two of them meet they have an instant attraction that neither of them want to act on. Why? Well Max does not do relationships and Jackie has never been in one. but they can't fight the attraction they have towards one another and when they finally decide to come together their union is beautiful! But nothing in this book is easy and you will find that poor Jackie must suffer for the man that she has fallen in love with. What does that mean?

I've read about the scientifically most agreeable level of pH in water before, but I had never tried any of it until now.Having had jugged tap water until I was blue in the face that hot workday, I figured there would be no better time to try my Essentia once I got home and I was all watered-out.

That's what it takes to achieve the perfect pH that makes it so easy to glide through all six servings these 1.5 liter bottles provide.

Corn ""reviewer""","[2, 2]","I was riveted by this book, especially by the contrast between Dominick's mother and Edie Kramer, who is a mistress/lover to Dominick's father. Dominick, torn between his loyalty to his mother and his unexpected, but strong passion for Edie, makes some decisions that result in heartbbreak for those around him. The resentment and anger he feels toward his father, who runs off for days at a time, goes on drinking binges and is unfaithful to his wife, is so well-written that it was painful to read at points, almost too realistic, if that is possible.  If this book sounds a bit soap opera-ish, believe me, it isn't. The author has a way of making the reader feel that Dominick's conflicting feelings are understandable and that he can feel both love for his mother and a yearning for Edie Kramer, who is sexy and seductive, and whose passionate nature excudes a strong power over a young boy. And Edie doesn't hesitate to use her allure to her advantage, when she realizes Dominick is attracted to her.  I have one criticism of this book. I wish the author had made the book even longer, added more detail about Dominick's emotions and those of his mother, father and others. I did feel as though there were several parts in the book where there would be a sudden decision or crisis without the actions or descriptions that made these fully understandable. Perhaps this was intentional but I still would have liked even more detail than provided.  Even so, this is a strong debut novel by a talented writer. The contrast between Edie Kramer and Dominick's mother, their different personalities, attitudes towards life and family, was fascinating to me. Dominick, too, is a compelling person, a teen trying to make a place for himself in spite of a difficult and challenging life.

AE07VPT4R6VX4,B00ET9XQQ8,Tracy,"[34, 34]","What attracted me to this phone most were two things; the size and android (also the price).  I needed a phone that I could keep in my pocket (with a case on it) and not feel like I'm carrying a tablet in there.  I used to have a blackberry curve 9360, and I loved the size of the phone and the QWERTY keyboard, but Blackberry just doesn't have much for apps, and they are slowly losing app support from google.  Also they don't do activesync email which was a problem for my work.  I couldn't find any other android phones (that work with Tmobile) in this size category (similar to an iphone size).The performance of this phone is very fast for day to day use (I'm not a gamer), and of course Android is awesome.  I will say that with the smaller screen it is more difficult to type than on my wife's Galaxy SII (I would assume this is the same with Iphones too), but with the auto-correct or SWYPE, it really isn't that bad.  I'm getting faster at typing on it.  The phone does feel ""cheap"", but that really is just because it is so small and so light (relative to other android devices).  Put a case on it and it feels great, I've got big hands and it still fits well.  The screen is very nice.The camera is normal, nothing to write home about it.  For me it gets the job done.  With the addition of an SD card I have no issues with the small amount of memory available.  If you're super paranoid about running out of application memory the phone can be rooted and you have options for storing apps on the SD card.  My wife's samsung came with much more bloatware than LG put on this guy, so no complaints there.All in all I'm very happy with the purchase, especially for $199.Update 9/23/2013After having this phone for a few weeks, I love it even more.  It really is fast, the LTE is blazing fast when I have it, and the battery lasts forever.  I love the smaller size of this phone, and have completely gotten used to typing on it normally, and with Swype typing (and I have big hands and fingers).  There is definitely a bug with Swype with the stock LG keyboard (noted in other LG phone reviews) where it deletes the second word every time, but I just downloaded the google keyboard, and it works awesome.  Not sure what other people want that this phone doesn't have, but I wouldn't trade it for anything.

Parts ran me $275 for 3/4 copper, 3/4 black iron, and 1 complete electrical circuit at Lowes.  Install completed in 1 weekend.  First 4 days of use was lousy.  The unit would shut off during showers.  Cold water pisses me off!  Shut off the shower water, then restart shower and unit would kick on again but only for 30-45 seconds.  Maddening.  Was convinced the newly installed propane tank system pressure was too low.  Called the propane company while standing in front of the unit and they agreed to come out and check their line pressure the next day.  After hanging up I thought to reboot the system so I shut it off, unplugged it, then turned it back on.  PROBLEM ALL FIXED with a reboot!  Next day the propane company came and found that the secondary regulator was malfunctioning.  Apparently the unit, with a reboot, adapted to low pressure and fixed itself.  After the pressure was adjusted I came home, did another reboot, and the unit has performed flawlessly since then.  I am surprised at the amount of water within the propane that collects in the bucket on the floor.  1.5 gallons in 45 days.  Setting at 140* was crazy hot, at 125* is plenty hot for most purposes.

A3M2WW0PO34B94,B000N3SU92,thornhillatthemovies.com,"[22, 26]","****1/2There is a lot going on in ""Little Children"", starring Kate Winslet, Patrick Wilson (the musical version of ""Phantom of the Opera"" and ""Hard Candy"") and Jennifer Connelly. I am not sure I even caught everything or understood all that I caught.Sarah Pierce (Winslet), a new stay at home mom, struggles with the solitude of her new role. Spending every moment with a three year old, who can barely communicate, tests the patience of the one-time English scholar. Sarah has a Masters, but ruefully admits she never wrote her dissertation and never received her PhD. One day, at a local playground, she interacts with a group of suburban moms and the differences are clear. They embrace motherhood, in different ways, making sure to bring snacks for the children's play break, and seem to relish all that their new role brings. One day, Brad (Wilson), a stay at home dad, who is supposed to be studying for his bar exam, brings his son to the playground. The three women quickly inform Sarah they have nicknamed him ""The Prom King"", because of his good looks. Sarah is amazed to find they have never talked to him. ""He makes us nervous."" One of the women bets Sarah five dollars that she won't get his phone number. Sarah not only gets his phone number, but he lets him in on the joke and they hug and kiss, to the shock of the uptight mothers. Soon, Brad, thoroughly emasculated by his wife, Kathy (Connelly), becomes slightly obsessed with finding ways to demonstrate he can still produce testosterone. For every time his wife talks him out of getting a cell phone, he stops to watch a group of teenage boys doing impressive skateboard moves. For every time she questions if he `really needs' that subscription to Sports Illustrated or Men's Fitness, he meets up with a group of guys and joins a nighttime Touch Football League. Soon, Sarah and Brad start a passionate affair. All the while, their quiet suburban community deals with Ronnie McGorvey (Jackie Earle Haley), a convicted pedophile who has just been released from prison. He returns to his mother's (Phyllis Somerville) home and she helps him endure the constant taunts of an overzealous neighbor, Larry Hedges (Noah Emmerich, the brother of the head of New Line Cinema who produced the film). Soon, all these people's fates will intersect in strange, unusual and interesting ways.""Little Children"", directed by Todd Field (""In the Bedroom"") and based on a book by Tom Perrotta, who co-wrote the screenplay with Field, may just end up being one of the best films of the year. But it feels a little less than perfect.The performances of the three leads are all outstanding. Kate Winslet, who has chosen many interesting roles throughout her career, continues this streak with Sarah Pierce. As the mid-30s mom of a three year old, she demonstrates many conflicting things with just about every word, every nuance. As a new mother, she clearly loves her daughter, but she feels stifled by the constant companionship of her daughter, longing for some adult conversation, some adult interaction. The second wife of an older man, she doesn't seem to have much need for her husband and he for her. She counts the minutes for him to return home, so she can spend a little time with a neighborhood friend doing her fitness walk. During the daily visit to the playground, she would probably find some comfort in the companionship of the other three mothers, but they are even less mature than she is. One, a domineering bully, insists her child adhere to a rigid schedule. She has carried this so far to schedule a weekly appointment to have sex with her husband. Another is clearly flirtatious and wants Sarah to do the daring things she is unable to. Then, Sarah meets Brad and is clearly attracted to the handsome young father.Brad (Wilson), loves his wife and freely admits she is a knockout, but because he is a stay at home dad, and money is tight, they have to watch every penny. His wife (Connelly) makes documentaries for PBS (we all know there isn't a lot of money in that) and they frequently receive help from her mother. After watching their son all day, he is sent to the library every night, to study for the bar exam, something he deems a fruitless pursuit. Instead, he spends most evenings watching a group of kids do stunts on their skateboards. One night, Bob pulls up and recruits him for a Touch Football game with a bunch of his former work colleagues, a group of cops. These few moments with other men, prove to be just the little boost he needs to maintain his sanity. Then he meets Sarah, and although he admits she isn't his type, they begin a passionate affair.Connelly's role, as Brad's wife, would technically be considered a supporting role, but it is equally important to the tapestry of the film. It isn't that Brad and Kathy don't love each other, they do, they are just too immature to express it. When Kathy suspects Brad of having an affair, she enlists the aid of her mother to come for a visit and `help Brad watch Aaron', their son. Soon, Grandma follows Brad everywhere, robbing him of any opportunity to have sex with Sarah.Jackie Earle Haley is also very good as Ronnie, the recently released pedophile. Clearly, this is a man who has not been `cured', but because he has served his time, he is released to live with his aging mother. May worries about her son. She knows he did something wrong, but she wants him to try to live a normal live. She won't be around forever and worries about what will happen to him after he dies.There are a lot of nice touches to the characters. Sarah joins a book group in which they discuss ""Madame Bovary"", a book she used to dislike but finds she know enjoys. Brad ditches an appointment, much like a petulant teenager forced to do something they don't want to do, because Sarah entices him to spend the time with her instead. Ronnie's mother is portrayed as a caring, doting mother who cares about her son and will continue to defend him until the day she dies.Director Todd Field has created two very impressive films so far. Field is clearly a director who will only work when a particular project strikes his fancy (""In the Bedroom"" was made over five years ago) and his attention to the project shows in almost every detail. Not only is ""Little Children"" well-written, it is a fairly unique experience as you watch it on the screen.Using a narrator, the director adds a literary feel to the film. Initially, this was a little off-putting to me, but Field introduces the technique early, uses it sparingly, and it doesn't feel obtrusive. Occasionally, the narrator adds a little levity to the story or further illuminates the feelings of a particular character. I was afraid this technique would detract from the performances, but if anything, it adds to them.""Children"" is, at times, a darkly humorous film. I found myself laughing out loud a few times and I realized the filmmaker intended this. At the same time, you also realize that many of the things you are laughing at are slightly exaggerated events that could happen in any of our lives. As you laugh, you may recognize you are uneasy because many of the things these people do are slightly unusual, or even a little unpleasant. For instance, Sarah's husband has a fetish which is revealed to us. It is initially funny, but we soon realize it is probably more common than we know. As we laugh, we also cringe because we probably know someone who has a similar fetish. Maybe a fetish we have always suspected, but were afraid to admit.The story, set in an Eastern suburb (I would imagine New York or Boston), is shot in a beautiful, almost luminous way. Every scene seems just slightly oversaturated, giving the film's summer setting another nod.Also, Field has designed a unique sound for the film. In many scenes, much of the ambient noise is reduced to favor a particular sound. As this is a suburb, a set of busy train tracks runs through the back of the community. Frequently, we hear the sound of a large train speeding down the tracks, further reinforcing a character's isolation or desperation. In one scene, the sound of many clocks becomes oppressive. In another, crickets become the only sound heard, despite cars driving by. Because of this unique sound design, our other senses become heightened and in a film, the only other sense that matters is our vision. I felt like I was watching the film more intently, with a keener eye.As good as Haley's portrayal of Ronnie is, and as interesting as the relationship between he and his mother is to watch, the character seems slightly unnecessary. As with the other characters, we spend a significant amount of time with Ronnie and his mother and the purpose of these characters seems to simply reinforce the main message of the film, which we already get. It isn't a problem to watch them, but it just seems a little superfluous.There are a number of powerful scenes in ""Little Children"", some of which I will remember for a long time. The scenes between Brad and Sarah, when they are having sex, are passionate, explicit and convey the desperation of their lives and the solace they find in one another. Kathy learns of her son's new friend and suggests to Brad that they invite the family over. Without saying a word, Connelly expresses volumes about her character's knowledge of the affair between Brad and Sarah. Each of the character's desperation to lead a different life is expressed in believable ways. A date between Ronnie and a homely woman is also particularly memorable.""Little Children"" is a very good, almost excellent film containing some great performances. It is a film that will stay with you. And that is, in some ways a good thing, in others, bad.""Little Children"" is a film that deserves to be remembered during Oscar season, but I fear one of two things will happen. Either it will be completely overlooked, or it will receive nominations and not a single award. The film is a tightly integrated ensemble piece.

I have never had a problem with them, but I don't like using any more chemicals than necessary, so I was looking for a more natural alternative. I had decent results with the Light Mountain, but be prepared for an ordeal requiring lots of time and mess. The box contains two bags of powder, instructions and rubber gloves. You need to have distilled water, glass or plastic mixing bowls, and a way to get the gloop onto your hair. I did not do the recommended strand test, which would have required a lot more time, and I still spent several hours. You need to mix the powders with boiling water and let them cure for an hour. Wash your hair. Apply gloop 1. I tried squeezing it through a hole in a Ziploc baggie, but I think just scooping up handfuls of it works as well. This process was a big mess in and around the sink, but I rinsed it all right away, and my sink was not stained. Then you put on a plastic shower cap, and keep your hair warm with a hair dryer while you wait to see a color change. I guess this wouldn't be so bad if you had one of those beauty salon dryers that you sit under, but using a blow dryer was a pain. Then you rinse it out. I went in the shower to do this. It is hard to rinse out, and the shower stall was covered in it. You repeat basically the same process with gloop 2, with the same mess in the sink and shower. I was happy with my hair when I was finished. I started seeing a lot of gray 3 to 4 weeks later, which is what also happens with other products I've used.

A1NT7ED5TATUAM,0195126289,Bill Slocum,"[2, 2]","Ambrose Bierce never had trouble giving vent to what was on his mind. More than any other American writer, even the more celebrated Mark Twain, Bierce dared to gore the sacred cows of his day. This came with a price, as Roy Morris, Jr. notes in his 1995 biography.Family ties were cut. Friendships were cast aside. Enemies were cultivated with a passion. Bierce may not have believed the pen was mightier than the sword, but he strove mightily to make up the difference.""One of the rarest amusements in life is to go about with an icicle suspended by a string, letting it down the necks of the unwary,"" Bierce wrote during his days as San Francisco's most feared columnist. ""The sudden shrug, the quick, frightened shudder, the yelp of apprehension are sources of pure, because diabolical, delight.""Bierce's fame rests today on three things: The black humor of his ""Devil's Dictionary"", the mind-bending short story ""Occurrence At Owl Creek Bridge"", and the way he vanished from the face of the earth. Morris presents a more rounded figure than that, of harsh invective and clean narrative whose own experience from seeing some of the worst action of the American Civil War hardened him into a thing of steel, direct in purpose though rather cold to the touch.Morris, a writer on Civil War subjects, gives Bierce's role in the war much of his focus. While noble ideals may still frame our understanding of the conflict, for Bierce it became a kind of senseless slaughter confirming an already dark world view. He served the Union with distinction, twice braving bullets to rescue wounded comrades, but in the end would describe patriotism as ""fierce as a fever, pitiless as the grave, blind as a stone and irrational as a headless hen.""For Bierce, life was a pointless parade of pain and loneliness, its amusement hollow in the end. ""The world was never Bierce's oyster, however much its irritations produced, on occasion at least, some fugitive pearls of acrid wisdom,"" Morris writes.The best part of the biography depicts Bierce in his element as a West Coast columnist castigating both the wealthy and the weak. Religion drew especial scorn from the inveterate atheist. ""After explaining the New Life for a series of years, it is proper that he should go and learn what it is like,"" he wrote of one minister's passing. ""We beg for all his co-workers a similar privilege.""Morris sometimes strives to psychoanalyze Bierce through his short stories, the most successful of which used either the Civil War or the supernatural as a theme. This gets thin after a while. He argues for any parental figure in Bierce's fiction to be read as substitutes for Bierce's own father and mother. He tries to pull clues from the stories of the complicated, often dark feelings Bierce had for women, though this doesn't quite square with the fact Bierce suffered from no lack of female companionship in his life.Morris's speculations seem on firmer, more fruitful ground when analyzing Bierce's final act, his disappearance, supposedly in Mexico where he went to see Pancho Villa and the Mexican Revolution. Here Morris examines the record and offers a theory that contradicts the established story but squares with Bierce's character as we come to know him here.Does Bierce's greatness lie more with his writing (he produced many short stories but never a novel) or his singular character? Morris puts forward a strong literary defense for Bierce, but in the end its his personality that stays with you longest. Cold, clear-eyed, dyspeptic, and completely reconciled to life at its worst, Bierce offers a case study that the pain that comes with telling hard truths can afflict the teller worse than the one being told.",4.0,The Icicle Man,1288137600.0,"10 27, 2010"

Orphaned and unmarried in a time when women are legal property of their fathers, husbands, and guardians, she finds herself at the mercy of an anonymous guardian who plans to establish her as a servant in far-off Scotland.With two months to devise a better plan, Julia's first choice to marry her childhood sweetheart is denied. But when a titled dowager offers to introduce Julia into society, a realm of possibilities opens. However, treachery and deception are as much a part of Victorian society as titles and decorum, and Julia quickly discovers her present is deeply entangled with her mother's mysterious past. Before she knows what's happening, Julia finds herself a pawn in a deadly game between two of the country's most powerful men. With no laws to protect her, she must unravel the secrets on her own. But sometimes truth is elusive and knowledge is deadly.[Review]This is going to be a quick and very short review. I loved the romance, mystery, and how the book was written.

The language is mesmerizing, and while most of this book is fairly muted, with more world-building scenes than plot scenes, there's enough tension - especially in the second half - to keep things interesting. And there's something simply addictive about the way it's written - even when there's not much going on plotwise, the words just flow forward in a way that makes the world come to life.

After all, I'd love to find some new bands that can make good toe-tapping, sing-along rock music. It is often relatively simple, and usually has an upbeat quality to it.Based on this album, Oasis isn't the answer to my quest. That's not to say Oasis is bad, but they are certainly nothing like what was recorded by classic rock bands like the Beatles, Stones, Zeppelin, Doors, Mac, Who, Airplane, etc. When you listen to albums by these bands, each song has a different sound to it. Styles, arrangements, melodies, tempos and harmonies change. The mix between country, blues, folk and other influences is ever-changing. Conversely, the first six cuts of BHN all sound practically the same (to me, at least). As someone else here says, every track is filled with guitars. The result is a wall of sound that make the songs almost indistinguishable from one another. The seventh cut, &quot;Fade In-Out&quot;, is somewhat different, and is probably my favorite cut. Individual instruments are discernable and there is a basic riff. The title song is also rather catchy, and I liked &quot;It's Getting Better&quot;, as well. &quot;All Around The World&quot; starts out OK, but instruments are gradually layered on until it ends up with a ponderous, droning sound like much of the other material here. Overall, studio tricks and sound effects are used liberally, but whatever melody is present is often buried except during the lead-ins and fade-outs at the beginning and end of songs. More varied arrangements and tempos would make BHN much more listenable.Many other reviewers here seem to be of the opinion that BHN isn't Oasis' best work, so I will probably give &quot;Morning Glory&quot; a try. I must say, however, that I was somewhat disappointed by this album. Perhaps my expectations were too high. Fans of this band or of this type of rock will probably find plenty to be pleased with in this album, but classic rock fans should proceed with caution. I found it interesting enough to give it a mediocre three stars, but I wasn't tapping my toes or singing along.",3.0,Not Great,985737600.0,"03 28, 2001"

This is not an accidental feature of the text, Zahavi shows that he understands that most of his audience are naturalists by disposition and/or training, and takes pains to point out the limits of that worldview. The book is really dense and after reading it twice, I still had to jump back and forth between chapters to make sure I understood what it said, but as a former naturalist in the narrow sense, I have to say this was an incredibly rewarding exercise and Zahavi has been what Hume was to Kant.

AC0YN916EOERB,047018549X,Brian Campbell,"[3, 6]","Kinzer puts forth an interesting, yet questionable theory. The events of 1953, in the overthrow of Mossadegh was an error in American foreign policy. American concern of the always threatening Soviet Union expanding her influence, as well as Britian's urging because of their concern for the nationalization of the Anglo-Iranian oil company, was the reason for American involvement. Mossadegh is portrayed as a lover of democracy, and the overthrow of him seems like a rush to judgement.Kinzer tries to review the great history of the Persian people, but does not go far enough in depth. His brief analysis of the Zoroastrian faith, combined with the Iranian belief of Shiism, did offer some interesting insight into the psyche of the Iranian people. However during pre-Mossadegh times many of the rulers of Iran seemed contrary to this psyche and Kinzer ignores this fact. He does however bring it into consideration after the overthrow of Mossadegh, in the Shah's  brutal rule. American support of the overthrow of Mossadegh, as well as the support for the Shah's brutal rule, led to anti-American sentiment.Overall it was a decent book, offering some insight into Iranian modern history. However, Kinzer relies way too much on the events of 1953 to link it to anti-Western sentiment and the birth of terrorism. The Israeli-Palestinian issue has agitated the Arab people, as well as slow economic progress throughout the Arab world.

I purchased my first about two years ago and it worked fine for the first 11 months when it developed the ""double-click"" problem.  This is where a single left mouse click actually sends a double click to your computer.  From reading online, it's a mechanical issue with the left click switch.  Also from my research it appears this is a common problem with the G7s, though I've seen it happen in other Logitech mice as well.It was still within 12 months of purchase and the RMA went very smoothly, I was extremely impressed.  They shipped me a replacement with almost no questions asked.  Unfortunately 14 months later, I'm in the exact same situation as before.  Left mouse button is sending double clicks.  I have yet to hear back from Logitech if I'm able to get this one replaced too, but it's highly doubtful.  Don't waste your money on a mouse that will last 1 year.On a lighter note though, this is by far the best feel of a mouse I have ever owned.  I love the size and contours.  There are a few extra buttons that, if you begin using them, are very handy.  There are also not so many extra buttons you click them by accident.  I'm also a big fan of the rechargeable battery system, very nice.  In the beginning you'll see about 2-3 day battery life with moderate use.  A year later I'm averaging about 1-1.5.  I don't really mind though, it takes about 5s to swap them out and with setpoint installed you can have it alert you when the battery is low.All-in-all, I honestly think this is one of the best mice I've ever used.

The shipping was quick and it arrived right before our cross-country drive from NM to MI. Now, I have to admit that when I was looking for a cargo box, I immediately went for the big brands like Thule and Yakima, but was turned off by the higher prices. This thing was almost twice as big as a box I initially looked at (it is 18 cu ft!) and half as much. I know I gave up the lifetime warranty by not going with the big names, but besides that, they all seem like big pieces of plastic that attach to the roof of a vehicle.Installation was a breeze--it took about 20 minutes to screw it onto the factory rack on our RAV4 and I was even able to heft it up there alone without scratching the car. After it was secure, I started loading it.Holy.Cow.We were able to put so much in there--2 plastic camping containers with all our gear, 2 tents, 2 folding bag chairs, 2 sleeping pads, blankets, 2 tarps--I kept testing the lid (which opens in the front--perfect for a vehicle like a RAV with a low trunk to stand in) to make sure it would close without forcing it and kept being able to put more stuff in it. The only worry I had was putting too much weight in there!Before deciding on this gem, I was also worried about any carrier affecting our MPG on long trips like this one. We traveled 1700 miles one way averaging 24.2 mpg with it on, and the second half of the trip must have been a bit uphill as it dropped to 23.4. Not bad with the amount of stuff we were carting around, though--we haven't done this trip in this vehicle without the carrier, so I don't have any numbers to compare it to, though I bet we could get around 28mpg without it.I am very happy with this purchase and I would highly recommend it to other people who want to haul around a lot of stuff to go camping. It was great to have so much room inside the vehicle while traveling--plus, since it rained while we were packing up, all the wet camping stuff went up top while we kept the interior of the vehicle clean and dry. The only down side is it is not long enough for our cross country skis or hockey sticks for winter vacations.Great deal, great product!",5.0,Fantasic Deal!,1309392000.0,"06 30, 2011"

Probably because I didn't have a sex life when I was in high school and still living under my mother's roof. When I turned eighteen, I got married and moved out. Considering my husband was nineteen at the time and working for ten dollars an hour, we didn't really have the money to replace furniture, so we moved my bed into our apartment. We quickly realized how truly loud this bed is and the canopy part will sway back and forth, meaning if it's close enough to the wall it most definitely will bang against it and possibly leave a mark on the wall. It got so bad to the point where even when you sat down on the bed, it would squeak. While my husband was in basic training, my mother moved in with me because I wasn't comfortable living by myself, and she told me she could hear me every time I rolled in bed at night. I checked to see if maybe some screws were loose and that was what caused the problem, but nope! The wrought iron seems to bend pretty easily too. So I suppose if you're single and not having sex... or married and not having sex... this bed would be alright.

The most problematic issue from my point of view, this unit does not handle avi files burned on dvd. many cheaper dvd players can do this, but it is shame that it can't. However, you are able to play many video formats through usb outlet (from flash memory and hard drive). It also does not handle divx hd, so, you would expect that blu-ray player should do that.

Happily you don't have to wait any longer to have your next fix as book two in the series, Sweet Revenge, is now available.Who wouldn't be love a series that features three awesome, hunky, hot, sexy, super-alpha heroes - who just happen to be brothers (and I keep hoping that the fourth brother will turn up alive sometime soon as well). The first book introduced us to these genetically engineered super soldiers who have hearts of gold as they try to track down the answers to a time bomb implanted near their spines as well as search out their missing youngest brother - who it seems may have been killed.Their enemy? The commander who raised them along with a doctor from hell - as well as other super soldiers who are still loyal to the ""dark side."" The first book was one that I couldn't put down and felt my adrenaline spiking towards the end of this fabulous page-turner. So, let me tell you, my expectations for book two were extremely high.Well Rebecca Zanetti met my expectations and raised me. I loved the way she introduced Matt and Laney and how she kept us on the edge of our proverbial seats between a serial killer, the search for the missing surgeon - who may or may not have answers for the brothers, and their continued avoidance of the commander and his followers.In addition, there are some fabulous sexy scenes between Laney and Matt, whose heat seemed almost to sizzle my Kindle! I loved how Zanetti's characters reveal themselves to the reader little by little. Both Matt and Laney have major trust issues - and their story is truly compelling.So five stars for this newest series entry and I can't wait till book three, Blind Faith, will be available in May.Fab Fantasy Fiction: [...]I received an eARC from the publisher through NetGalley for use in this review.",5.0,Rebecca Zanetti's five star Sweet Revenge features a sexy super alpha hero,1386028800.0,"12 3, 2013"

AYM76JWI220Z4,B00002262Z,"Victor H. Agresti ""remodeling-guy""","[2, 2]","I've owned two HTC HRLS-5 Mobile Bases since the early 1990's.  One supports a Delta 28-203 closed-base band saw (precursor to the model 28-248); the other supports a Delta 31-731A Belt and Disc Finishing Machine.  This base can support any machine that would fit inside it's base measurements of 16 5/8"" x 19 1/4"".  It could be used for a somewhat larger tool if you raise the tool on plywood above the box frame of the base.  In addition, the angled area at the single wheel end provides additional space, especially if the tool to be supported has a rounded base.Pros:- Clean, smooth lines due to one-piece frame construction, give the base a custom look.  A matter of taste, but I prefer this clean look versus the erector set look of an adjustable-sized tool base such as the HTC2000.- Have used it for well over a decade with no problems and zero maintenance.- Tool & mobile base roll about easily.- Three-wheel fixed-size bases cost less than 4-wheel fixed-sized bases of the same quality.-  Three-wheel bases won't wobble, even if the floor isn't flat.  I.e., a four-wheel base would wobble if only three of its wheels touched the floor.  If there is a wobble with this base, it's the tool wobbling on the base itself (use shims), not the HTC base wobbling on the floor.- A tool sitting on this base will be nearly flush with the rear frame of the base.  Also, as the wheels are on the sides, the rear of the base will be flush with whatever it's next to.  E.g., I have two tools next to each other on these bases; they, on their bases, are back to back, so the machines are virtually touching (when not in use), wasting no floor space.-  I have other three-wheel HTC bases, supporting a Delta drill press, sander, and jointer, and they are all excellent. I own six HTC bases and they are all high quality.Cons:- Three-wheel bases are inherently less stable than four-wheel bases; i.e., tools on them, especially taller tools, are somewhat more tip-prone.  (For the same reason three wheeled ATVs are more tip-prone than their four-wheel cousins.)  Some three-wheel bases (but not this one)  mitigate this with outboard stabilizers at the two corners by the single wheel.- This is really minor, but you have to lean over to tighten the plastic-handled wheel lock screws; and to loosen them to roll the tool again.  Some bases have a wheel lock operated with your foot, which is more convenient.The oldest of my HTC bases had the wheel-lock screw poke into the rubber wheel to brake the unit, while newer HTC bases have a flat piece of spring steel between the wheel and screw, to protect the wheel.  Both kinds of wheel locks work fine.",4.0,I own two of these fine mobile bases...,1135728000.0,"12 28, 2005"
AK9UPC78LIPIR,044991190X,maelje,"[3, 3]","John Updike's ""Couples"" is not his best novel, but it's not his worst, either. This is, in fact, a very good book about marriage and infidelity, set in the 1960s as the sexual revolution swept over America.Updike published the book in 1968, as that revolution was still building; one coult argue that the sexual revolution did not reach its peak until sometime in the early 1970s. The novel focuses on several fictional New England couples, and Updike is at his best in this book not in the more explicit sexual scenes, but rather in the passages that chronicle the various characters' faint but very real dissatisfactions with their lives.Unfortunately, there is no character in these pages nearly as compelling as Harry Angstrom, (anti-)hero of Updike's tetralogy of ""Rabbit"" novels. Piet Hanema, the main character here, is vivid enough, but one senses he was more elusive for Updike -- there's something ghostly about the man, something not quite real or as fully created.It is, however, somewhat unrealistic of me to demand such a character from ""Couples."" I don't think Updike intended it as a deep map of one man's mind, body and soul, as the ""Rabbit"" novels offer. Instead, this is more of an ensemble cast, and an exploration of several lives -- including musings on how a single individual's actions can have devastating effects on others.""Couples"" is a worthy novel, though modern readers might actually find it somewhat quaint now. The sexual revolution ended not in a radiant burst of everlasting free love but with the specter of AIDS, and the realization that with freedom comes responsibility.

First, I really enjoyed the historical information in the book, you could tell that the author has extensive knowledge on the subject.

During his stay in Russia, Miles opens a Pandora box and gets mixed up in a twist of events that lead to many assassination attempts by the Russian mafia to kill him.

In this book the author exaggerates about Russia and Russian poverty and the mafia.Without giving too much away the plot sounds very cheesy and unrealistic, even for historical fiction I expected more from this book. As I mentioned before the historical facts mixed with fiction about the demise of the Romanov family is written very well and captures the readers imagination and again the ""what if"" pops up when reading these events.At some point in the book the author uses Russian words to give the reader the feeling that the events are happening in Russia, however these words are not accurate. For example the word chernie is used to describe Miles Lord an African American. The word cherni means black, chernie is plural and means blacks which does not make sense when you only talking about one person.I think the story had great potential if it was better written but lost me a little in its unrealistic plot.

It was cut from the same mold as Toscanini's but seemed less intense and hectic (two qualities that haven't worn well in Toscanini's approach). Szell's reading hasn't changed--it's a model of disciplined ensemble, perfect balance, and impeccable taste--but I must have, becasue I keep missing the humor, warmth, and expressed joy in this symphony.  Scine those are all subjective qualities, I won't offer them as anything else.The Pastorale is a particularly difficult work for many conductors, and the gorgeous playing here is quite relazed, especially for Szell. He outdoes great competitors like Karajan (fast and bloodless), Giulini (heavy-handed), Bohm (dawdles) and Klemperer (stiff). All made renowned recordings of this symphony, so Szell has given us an outstanding CD, no doubt. Sony certainly should remaster it, but compared to the original LP on Epic, this transfer is quite an improvement.  As for a five-star recommendation, no one bids fair to improve upon Bruno Walter with the Columbia Sym., also on Sony, and for sheer depth of expression there are a number of Furtwangler performances, all slow and in poor-to-middling mono.",4.0,"An acclaimed reading, but it doesn't reach for Beethoven's sense of joy",1167782400.0,"01 3, 2007"

A3NHUQ33CFH3VM,B003BKNTVS,Citizen John,"[1, 1]","This book in paperback was printed with small font, making it somewhat physically challenging to read for some people.  The Hard Cover edition is far better.Dark Ages America was published in January 2007 and I purchased this book and read it in November 2007. Because of the nature of this book, I waited to review it after having plenty of time to think about it. I think Berman is at his best as a culture critic of the U.S., and unfortunately his prediction of economic decline has been playing out.Berman made hundreds of strong points but not in a conventionally organized way. I think this book is a collection of his notes on many well-documented sources. I found this approach to be very effective because it touched on hundreds of salient points that support the essence of what Berman wants to communicate. A preponderance of examples can make an argument even without the interesting analysis provided in Dark Ages America (DDA).I was already worried about the future of America. DDA put me further along that path, leaving a feeling of impending doom. That's why I gave this book a lot of time before attempting to review it. It's as if the country had reached the high point in its system life cycle and would have to renew itself only through a giant destructive process.Berman's is at his best when he operates as a social critic. DAA makes a lot of relevant points about the decline of the social quality of life. This is where Berman shines, and I'd like to see him discuss these things in open-ended TV interviews. Something important has been gradually lost been lost socially in this country, and I'd like to know more about it. People have slowly become less trusting. This is a trend that adds stress and reduces the quality of life.I count Berman as one of the few pundits unafraid to take one side of an issue and make a stand. Berman calls us out for allowing our social lives to deteriorate in this country. Berman refutes arguments that support the notion of social deterioration as inevitable. I hope Morris Berman publishes another book to discuss all the things that have happened since he completed Dark Ages America.",3.0,Hardback Edition Better than Soft Cover Edition - Larger Font,1283644800.0,"09 5, 2010"

A23EZA2MJB4HGH,0373776098,Sonoma Lass,"[0, 0]","One thing I loved about this book was the way it was set up by the story in the Guy Next Door anthology. That told the story of Eric and Beth's meeting and the hot one-night stand that was supposed to be all there was between them. By putting that encounter in the prequel story, followed by several months of waiting and then the first two siblings' books, Dahl and her publisher made me wait for Eric and Beth to be continued just as they had to wait. When I read this book, I really felt the effect of that build-up, and it made me better able to empathize with both characters.As I've come to expect from Dahl, these characters have issues on which they need to work. I like that in this book, both characters are mature enough to know that about themselves; it's why they shy away from commitment. Both of them have self-esteem issues dating back to childhood, too. But I found Beth a lot more likable than Eric; I was proud of her every time she stood up for herself and disappointed when she didn't, although Dahl made me understand WHY she didn't.  Eric was a jerk, and sometime even when I theoretically understood why, I didn't like him.Part of the problem was the overall timing of discovery in the series.  Eric was a jerk throughout the books, but I didn't find out why until this book, and by then I was used to thinking of him as selfish, uncompromising and just plain mean.  I also had some difficulty with this book in terms of how it followed on the book before. The end of Bad Boys Do seemed pretty optimistic about Eric's relationship with his brother Jamie, but early in this book I felt like that progress was almost all lost, which gave me a retroactively less positive view of the happy ending of the second book.  (Worse because that was my favorite book of the three, I think.)Other than a few moments of calling Eric names, though, and wondering why he and Jamie seemed determined to ignore the rapprochement that I thought they had achieved, I really enjoyed this book.  It has some funny moments, some devastating emotion, and some very hot sex. I liked the way the overall plot arcs were resolved for the series, I thought Eric and Beth were good together and earned their happy ending, and the story sucked me in. Twice, because when I went to look something up for a comment I made elsewhere, I got sucked back in and ended up rereading the whole book less than a month after I first read it.

It actually includes a glowing introduction by former deputy director for intelligence of the CIA Ray Cline. It also heaps praise on the scumbag and Marijuana witchhunter Harry Anslinger throughout the book. But the basic gist here is that the drug trade in America is a Communist plot and that the commies control the Lions share of the illegal trade trade in America. Their plan is that drugs would demoralize America and then the commies could step in and take over America. Ha ha! Most of this information supposedly came from a former Soviet Union General named Jan Sejna that defected to the United States in 1968.Its pretty well documented at this point that the CIA smuggled Heroin into the United States using the CIA front Air America and that they more or less created the crack cocaine plague of the 1980s mainly in order to raise money for the Contras.

There were numerous typos like missing words, duplicated words or insertions of the wrong word. While they didn't really distract from the plot, they did cause you to stumble a bit.  Two things that did bother me were continuity errors. One involved the heroine's alarm system (midway through the book, she sets the house alarm, but later in the book there is a discussion about installing an alarm system). The second is the timing of when the heroine meets Jude. Initially we are told the heroine meets Jude when he comes walks in on a pedicure party when Gabby is two. Later, we are told that the heroine met Jude when she was pregnant with Gabby.With better editing and more practice, I think this author will be very successful. I'd like to see her work on opening up her characters more. Her writing style seems very stiff: person a does this and person a does that. It's all very third person.

At the time I bought this, the Lenovo configured machine was $160.00 more than I paid on Amazon but a couple days later the difference was only $100 in favor of Amazon.

AFZNJHDGE0DUJ,0140386335,Zadius Sky,"[2, 2]","I'd have to admit - I've had never read the book until a few weeks ago and brought the book from a used bookstore. However, I did saw the movie during the mid-1980s and it always been a part of my childhood memories because I have always loved it. It wasn't until a friend's recommendation that I should read the book and I found myself reading it with such an awe. There is a saying of the modern times: ""The book is better than the movie.""So, I finally got a chance to read this book by Ende, and I have to say, it's such an fascinating novel. I can most certainly tell the major differences between the book itself and the movie version(s).There are basically two journeys as portrayed in the novel: Bastian's reading Atreyu's journey by reading a book and Bastian's own journey inside the said book. There are a lot of themes in this book that can be grasped by adults, so this book is not just for children (though, it meant to bring out the child in ourselves).I have found it interesting to see Atreyu's journey as really about bringing Bastian into the story. It appears to be a sort of a sense of dissociation - escaping into the story (or meeting of two selves) - and then Bastian became completely involved in the story and saved the Fantastica by giving the Childlike Empress a name, which starts a new cycle of life in Fantastica. When Bastian became involved in the story, he was wearing the AURYN (medallion) that would grant him many wishes but down the road, it became clear that more wishes he wanted, the more memories he loses. And, he would lose his ""Self"" or his sense of identity. Atreyu and Falkor are the ones who see the problem with Bastian's continuous wishing. The more Bastian engaged in his own wishful thinking, the less ""real"" he becomes. And, Atreyu has led a rebellion to go against Bastian and take the medallion away from him. In the end, Bastian lost all senses of who he was but with Atreyu's help, he was able to ""go back home.""It appears to me that Bastian and Atreyu are different aspects of each other (since they saw each other in the Magic Mirror). Atreyu never stray from his goal and knew the dangers while Bastian was continuing to wishful think, wanting to be an ""Emperor,"" and his wishes led to his downfall. Bastian's actions were surely selfish and in the world where his wishes were become so true and real to him.All in all, it's an fascinating story (and regretted that I didn't read it earlier) and this novel challenges one's imagination as regards to the fantasy world. When we are drawn to living in fantasies, we can always return to reality with fresh new eyes and new energies as simulated by these fantasies, such as fairy tales (with deep meanings to them, unlike the modern ""stories""/films that achieved nothing more than entertainment).With much ecstatic, I would surely recommend this book to anyone, both children and adults.",5.0,An Fascinating Novel,1355616000.0,"12 16, 2012"

ATJR15V2TH6JB,B002FQJT3Q,Ben Kickert,"[2, 2]","There are plenty of great reviews out there on the new kindle, so I decided to forgo a true assessment and list the top 10 reasons why the Kindle is right for me.1. Portability - My wife and I are about to move overseas and we simply cannot take our whole book collection with us; with the Kindle, we can a significant portion of it.  It is also awesome for long plane flights.2. Free 3G - Sure, we paid an extra $50 for 3G, but we have no ongoing fees with that.  Since we don't have smart phones, it is awesome to have access to free portable internet where ever we are.  Granted the Kindle web browser is a bit slow and clunky, it is perfect for looking something up on Wikipedia on the fly, or for checking email when away from a computer.3. Extra-long battery life - The Kindle is advertised as having up to a month of battery life (assuming you leave the wireless off).  For my typical usage I am getting closer to 2 weeks.  It is great to be able to have an electronic device at hand that I don't have to worry about recharging every other day.  An iPad wouldn't even make it through half of a trans-Atlantic flight, but my Kindle will last my whole trip.4. Cheaper books - Of course I did spend roughly $200 on the device to start with, but now that I have it, most books are 30-50% cheaper than the printed version.5. Book Samples - 5 years ago most of the books I read were either on recommendation of friends, or required reading for class.  Now I find a good portion of the books I buy are because I am looking for a book on a specific topic; often I don't know which books are considered well written and which are not.  With Kindle samples, you can download the first chapter or so and get a feel for yourself.6. Free Classic (and other) Books - There are lots of book that I know I should read.  Many of these I have purchased, but never gotten around to reading.  Now I can have access to them, but not feel as bad if I don't get to them immediately.  Amazon has a great collection of public domains book and many others as well.7. Search books - Sure print books have indices, but that pales in comparison to the ability to search for a specific phrase.  This is very helpful for the Kindle Bible and for trying to find a particular section of a book I have previously read.  Along the same lines, I love having interactive tables of contents.8. Highlights and notes - This is a blessing and a curse.  I love to mark up my books when I read them - it helps me comprehend and makes it easier when I go back and skim.  While it is very handy to be able to highlight on the fly without needing to carry a pen, it is just not the same writing a note on the Kindle as it is marking up the margins of a book.  That being said, there are two ""Killer Features"" related to highlighting and notes.  First, you can view all your highlights in one spot, which makes skimming super easy.  Second, you can view the passages most highlighted by other users.  This is a great way to get a feel for a book and to draw your attention to key sections.9. Reading Experience - I know many people are hesitant about reading on an e-reader, thinking they will always prefer a good ole paper copy.  But, I absolutely love reading on my kindle.  I love the light weight and easy to hold design.  The e-ink is easy to read and the adjustable fonts are great.  I actually find myself getting less distracted while reading the kindle.10. Games - This is a minor highlight, but hey, I needed another to make it a round number.  The games are nothing special, but they are great for passing the time while on the road or looking to kill a few minutes of time.  Many of the word based games are free and slightly educational.",5.0,Top 10 Reasons the 3G Kindle is right for me,1293667200.0,"12 30, 2010"

Elizabeth Harding is the third Harding sister and she has moved to Wyoming to open her medical practice. She has big dreams and plans and is sure that she will have many patients. When she has a run-in with her neighbor, Jason, she learns that he disapproves of her profession. And unfortunately for her many of the people feel the same way and do not want to see a woman doctor. Jason also has troubles with his law practice when he and the town find out that he defended a guilty man whom they all thought was innocent. As the two spend more time together, Jason soon changes his mind about Elizabeth and the two become friends. What neither Jason nor Elizabeth counted on was for that friendship to develop into something more. When one of the wealthiest men in Cheyenne is murdered the two must work together in order to see the guilty person caught.This is the third book in the Westward Winds trilogy and it is another well written story that will transport you to 1887 Cheyenne.

Sprague de Camp, one of the masters of the time travel story once wrote a story called A Gun For Dinosaur staring Reginald Rivers and his time safari.  Almost thirty-five years later he began writing more stories about Mr. Rivers and dinosaur hunting.  These stories were collected into a volume called RIVERS OF TIME.These stories begin in much the same way with Reginald Rivers explaining company policy to a new client.  Rivers then proceeds to narrate a tale of a previous safari to explain his point.  The other common thread is that while being surrounded by dinosaurs of all shape and sizes, the real trouble and danger comes from the people.The first story, A Gun For Dinosaur, was slightly rewritten to bring it more up to date with accepted dinosaur knowledge and theory.  One story even has a client wanting to witness the meteor strike that wiped out the dinosaurs while another has a religious team trying to disprove evolution.So, if you like time travel, dinosaurs and good human interaction, try and pick up this collection.",4.0,Let's Hunt Dinosaurs,1084838400.0,"05 18, 2004"

It generally functions as designed (flawlessly), but in the short time I've had it I've had the following issues:1) On a long trip it ""forgot"" where we were going mid-trip and had us going off the highway, then back on, then off.  I had to cancel the trip and re-program our destination.2) If you're not using the unit (i.e. a normal commute where you know where you're going) and you hit a ""detour"" on the trip, it takes sooooo long for the unit to turn on and then for the sattelites to find it that it serves almost no value.3) It dropped me off at an abandoned building and proudly said ""arriving at your destination"".  The site was 5 miles from our destination.4) I was on a trip and it started to really rain.  I asked the unit to find a store close to my route and Wal-Mart appeared.  When I got there it was a Sam's Club.  No luck there.In fairness, I'll highlight my favorite points too:1) It shows you trip statistics (miles, time, avg. speed)2) You always know how far you are away from your destination3) If you hit traffic and hit ""detour"" it does do a good job of finding an alternate route.4) Generally if you ask it to find something along your route it does a good job.  The Wal-Mart thing only happened once it just tended to annoy me because it was raining.5) It come with a ton of accessories (car plug, house plug, mounting brackets)6) It has an MP3 player and you can also listen to audio books on it.7) The directions are really good and they give you plenty of warning8) It has a number of travel features that you could add to it (with downloadable software) including Fodor's Travel guides and foreign language assistance.I'm sure the troubles it experiences are typical of all of these devices.

Too me it feels like they only tested the controls with a small set of users, who were probably all similar in size, build and color.Needless to say, this game does not properly pick up my movements, most of the time. The first time I played this, there were many expletives thrown out due to the fact I had to listen to the whole entire intro and the tutorial. At one point in the game I was able to, by some means, use an unknown motion to skip a tutorial but I have no clue what it was and ended up dancing around like a monkey with flees, in order to find the proper motion, but to no avail.Once the horrifying, mind-numbing process of learning how to play the game was finished, I learned that the game was requiring me to become a world class limbo dancer in order to turn. Frustation got the best of me and I turned it off. Later I decided that maybe my stance wasn't proper or the lighting was off so I decided to turn on the flood lights, put on my back brace and give this game another try.After turning on the game and hearing that pencil-in-the-ear intro music again, my second try got off to a rough start, accidentally choosing the wrong menu options but I eventually made my way to Offline Grand Prix mode, I endured through the horribly dramatic love affairs of Sonic and some other pink character, but alas when the game play came back on, even after doing initially better than my previous attempts, getting first place in the practice run, I decided to retire my efforts permanently and will attempt to return this horrible excuse for a game.TL;DR:Don't buy this game.",1.0,Breaks your spirit and your back,1290297600.0,"11 21, 2010"

To have rules and agree, or to hurt and kill.""Then above quote said by one of the main characters is actually the crux of this extremely interesting movie based on the 1954 novel of the same name by William Golding.The story is actually a simple one.  A plane crashes on an uninhabited island.  The survivors are a group of privileged preadolescent British schoolboys including some choirboys.  They must learn to survive on this island until they are rescued.We get to see what happens as the boys adapt to their new environment.  We also get to observe how the veneer of civilization slowly erodes from them.  We get to see how their primitive instincts overtakes the majority of them and how their moral compasses seem to get lost.This is not just a tale of lost innocence.  It's a case study of the behaviour of kids in the wilderness.This movie was not filmed in a studio somewhere but the director (Peter Brook) and his young cast of school kids really were on a desert island together.  (Filming took place entirely in Puerto Rico and on the island of Vieques)The actors were young amateur actors, few of whom ever acted again.For those that have read the novel, this film closely follows the trajectory of the book.This movie was filmed in black and white, adding yet another dimension to it.  This particular disc has a newly, restored digital film transfer.Finally, the DVD set (the Criterion Collection released in 2013) has a long list of excellent extras including audio recordings of William Golding reading from his novel ""Lord of the Flies,"" accompanied by the corresponding scenes from this film.  A booklet is also included which has a superb essay about this movie by a film critic and an excerpt from the director's autobiography.In conclusion, this is truly a unique movie that shows that even innocent schoolboys can be reduced to the level of...savages.(1963;  1 hr, 30 min;  black and white;  2 discs;  full screen;  14 scenes)&lt;&lt;Stephen PLETKO, London, Ontario, Canada>>XXXXX",5.0,"""Kill the pig!

Also, lack of ability to adjust left me with the bottom band riding uncomfortably up my chest, but there was no way to fix that.  So I sent back the Small and ordered a Medium.  I swear the only thing that changed was the label - because I would have sworn I was putting the Small on again!  Being an idiot, I tried the Large too, and it was no better than the others.So for those dissatisfied with Genie, you should give Sofra a chance.

Note that the lamp needs to be fully submerged to prevent eye damage from the ultraviolet light when used with transparent bottles, so you can't do this when the bottle is less than about 1/2 full.The basic idea behind this device is that, when inserted in 1/2 to 1 liter of relatively clear water, the light disrupts the DNA of ""the baddies"" (most especially viruses, which any filter above 1 micron will NOT reliably stop), keeping them from multiplying. In effect, they become food.

A3DOPYDOS49I3T,B003V264WW,Confucious,"[1, 1]",The old hair dryer kicked the bucket and this new one came along. It is a pretty nice looking dryer with pink accents. It can either be heavy or not depending on that arm of yours. Some of my friends were saying it was lite and some were saying it was heavy. To me it seems about average to other dryers. It blows hot air fairly quick and it is not as loud as the one I had previously. It might be that this dryer is new and hasn't been filled with dust and all. Maybe that was the problem with my old one. I like the fact that it comes with the diffuser. I have curly hair and with the diffuser I am able to dry my hair with pure heat and no strong air blowing on my hair. What's great is that the dryer feels good in your hand. The outside finish has a grip and feels good in your hands. Some dryers are shiny and tend to feel slippery once your palms start sweating and it becomes more difficult holding it in your hands. Not this one. The matte finish feels good on your hand and doesn't slip. In the past I have had a few blow dryers. The longest run with one was 9 years. Once that one broke down I purchased a few and never lasted a year. If this one makes it past the first year then it will probably last a couple of years.

References to Rice Paddies, the smartest man in the world (IQ wise), Bill Gates, and the author's own story (to name a few).

The other day, however, I received an email from a company that let me know the music score was now exclusively available at iTunes.  This prompted me to both download the score and see the movie once again.I think I enjoyed the movie even better the second time.I rented this the first time based on the plot outline. I haven't been a Demi Moore fan since that horrid horrid movie she did a few years ago where she had two lives-- one in America, one in France.  Oh, she was just horrible in that even-more horrible movie!  I really decided then and there that I wasn't a fan and she could not act.But, she did an excellent job in this role.I think what makes this movie so interesting-- and even better the second time-- is that there is a real mix of supernatural phenomena combined with non-supernatural.  It can be a bit confusing at first, since the viewer is not sure if he or she is witnessing ghostly events or not.What sets this movie apart from so many others is the ambience. Yes, it was beautifully filmed.  But, even more so, the story moved along.  There were so many things happening, so many interesting twists.  Never, however, did the movie overwhelm the senses. It was quiet, serene, peaceful, yet always moving forward. Everything worked very well together.Finally, the cast was really first rate.  Hans Matheson was excellent.  I am looking forward to seeing him again and plan to rent Deathwatch next (he's in that).  And, the others were excellent, too.",4.0,I really love this movie,1152662400.0,"07 12, 2006"

It already has pretty good battery life but I wanted more for travels. This battery fits in the bay were the CD/DVD drive normally lives. I just finished a three week trip including many hours on planes and giving presentations. With the monitor brightness turned down the combination of this secondary battery and the main battery results in well over 6 hours of heavy use.I was doing a lot of editing of things like PowerPoint presentations, video, graphics, email, and programming in C++. I was also surfing the web in airports and conference rooms. When I could, I plugged in, but didn't really need to. I never plugged in during 4 hours of presentations that I gave back to back at the conference. When I finished my talks I still had something like 50% of my battery life remaining. The point is that I was using the hard drive a lot, the WiFi and lots of CPU cycles and still got excellent battery life. Far and away the biggest drain on the battery is the screen brightness. Keep that down and this combination of two batteries is really deluxe and it is not all that heavy.I never fully drained the two batteries even in each of the two full days of bouncing around in airports so I can't report on an exact amount of time that they last. At one point I did get down to just a few percent of power left, but that was after not plugging in for two days while doing a fair amount of intermittent use of the laptop with the screen at various brightness levels.NOTE: Everyone says that you must purchase the more powerful charging brick. Since my old power supply died at the same time that I replaced the battery and added this second battery I cannot attest to how well it charges with the 65W supply.For what it is worth, the way the batteries are used is that the laptop runs on the secondary battery first until it is drained then starts running on the primary battery. This is excellent because it allows you to use the CD/DVD drive if you need to and you will know that your primary battery is as strong as it can be when you swap the secondary battery for the drive in the bay.",5.0,"Works great, exactly as expected",1278115200.0,"07 3, 2010"

AG4U11RFDY7LU,0345535871,Virginia Campbell,"[6, 8]","Superb storyteller Mary Balogh continues her ""Survivors' Club"" series with Book Two, ""The Arrangement"". The Survivors' Club is a group of veterans of the Napoleonic Wars who each returned home grievously wounded and forever changed. They all found refuge in the home of the Duke of Stanbrook, and the club was formed. ""The Arrangement"" is the story of Vincent Hunt, Viscount Darleigh, who was blinded by cannon fire in his very first battle at age seventeen. A younger son, he later inherited his title unexpectedly at age nineteen due to the death of his uncle, who had no living heir. Four years later, at almost twenty four years of age, Vincent is suffocating from the well-meaning intentions of his family to find him a suitable wife who will be understanding about his blindness. Tired of not being allowed to be his own man and having his life controlled by loving but meddling kin, he flees his familial home, taking along with him his manservant and friend, Martin. Traveling for weeks, experiencing the freedom of the outdoors under the watchful eye of Martin, and having time to think for himself allows Vincent to come to a decision about his future. He will take full possession of his uncle's estate, Covington House, and he will deal with his blindness as a challenge, not an impediment. He will also choose his own wife, in his own time. His arrival at Covington House causes a stir in the community, and once again, matrimonial machinations are in the works. One neighboring family in particular, the Marches, see Vincent as a prize husband for their daughter, Henrietta. Living in the March household is a young woman, Sophia Fry, taken in by her father's sister when she had nowhere else to go. When Sophia deliberately foils a plan by the Marches to snare Viscount Darleigh, they evict her from their home. When Vincent learns what has happened, he immediately goes to Sophie at the vicarage where she spent the night. Although he has just met her, and only shared a brief time in Sophie's company, Vincent knows she is different from other women, and he offers her an ""arrangement"". They will marry, and if there is no heir within a year, they will live separate lives, but remain married. Sophie never imagined that she would ever be married, much less to a viscount. Small, shy, and lacking self-esteem, she has always been ""the mouse"". Now, she has a chance to rise above the dreariness of her existence and live a life of privilege. But will it lead to happiness? Sophie and Vincent become quick friends, and their marriage is a whole new world for them both. Their sweetly sensual discovery of each other, and their growth and maturation as individuals slowly, but surely, leads them to a deeper relationship. Sophie often acts as ""eyes"" for Vincent, describing the details around them, but she always treats him with respect to his dignity. Vincent cannot see his wife, but he values her and enjoys her company, and certainly finds her desirable as a lover, and she comes into her own under his care. Will the arrangement between them become a contract they don't want to break? Will it deepen, and become richer and more rewarding--a true love match? Sophie and Vincent sought freedom from the circumstances which were thrust upon them at a young age through no fault of their own. Their unconventional marriage agreement was made to grant them that freedom, yet in each other, they find loving and being loved in return is a higher form of freedom than they could ever have dreamed.",4.0,they find loving and being loved in return is a higher form of freedom than they could ever have dreamed,1372550400.0,"06 30, 2013"

A4SKIA2A7IDRX,075640830X,,"[0, 0]","Sixth in the Kara Gillian urban fantasy series revolving around former Detective Gillian around whom demons circle.My TakeI can't decide if I like this series for the twist Rowland has put on our view of demons &#8212; that revelation from Helori at the end certainly ups the interest level! &#8212; or if it's the characters I enjoy so much. They're distinct with their own personalities, and Rowland definitely comes up with interesting scenarios in each installment. There's humor and drama, and love. Lots of love. It's homey. Odd, how homey this series is with all the demons running amuck, lol.As for this installment, there is a lot going on: kidnappings, traps, torture-murders, betrayals galore, new magics are introduced, the posse increases in size, and many truths spill forth. From the truths about Ryan and Szerain, the origins of the demonic lords, Mzatal's past, Idris' origins, and Ryzhtahl's activities. Some of these truths come about as a result of testings, some from detective work, while yet more spill over from battles fought.I like that Kara doesn't get truly angry over Zack and Ryan moving in. What they've done makes sense, and I LOVE all the changes they've made! I also love that Rowland keeps it somewhat real by having Kara angry inside about some of this. Although, I do like the idea of kitchen elves. I'd like some'a them.Wow, it was intense about Szerain rising up in Ryan &#8212; who doesn't know he's being a human prison for the demon lord. A nice bit of conflict introduced with Ryan loving Kara and unhappy about Mzatal's interest, but Szerain not being interested. The truth about Ryan really hits home in this one as we learn how the real Ryan died, and it's enough to make you want to cry. Jill also learns the truth about Zack.The road trip was a bit tame. Useful, but I had hoped for some kind of dramatic attack. In fact, the whole story was tamer than it could have been. I liked it. Don't get me wrong. However, there were a number of areas in which Rowland could have ratcheted up the tension and drama and created a really great story. There was the whole Rowan/Kara thing with the posse reminding Kara that she's Kara but I'm not getting the feeling that she's in danger except with the boys continually harping on this. The sudden reluctance on Zack's part seems weird. Was he all fine in the previous stories because Mzatal wasn't in the picture? I like the tension brought into the story with Bryce and Paul, I just wish it had been more, um, intense. Just as I would have liked (liked to hate?) it if Kara had been more concerned about Mzatal loving her. It was too easy.I'm worried about Tessa. She's gone off on this vacation, but she was also one of Katashi's students. And the bad guys are targeting people Kara cares about.As I said, I liked it, but I would have loved it if my heart rate had gone pitter-pat really fast.The StoryPulled into the demon realm in Sins of the Demon , 4, Kara is on the mend and learning fast. Not fast enough to interrupt Idris' transfer to Earth and his continued torments, however.The chase is on, on Earth that is, as Kara comes home to a changed home and new tenants. From lone summoner to a family. One who will remind her of her Kara identity as they work to prevent the Rowan identity from taking her over while they hunt for Idris' captors and struggle to keep those they love safe.The CharactersKara Gillian is now a consultant assigned to the FBI task force on the arcane and focused on training and conditioning her physical, mental, and arcane skills. She has an affinity for the grove as well as Vshul, Szerain's essence blade. &#34;Rowan&#34; is the thrall identity Rhyzkahl wants to take over Kara. Eilahn is a syraza demon assigned to be Kara's bodyguard. She's lots of fun! Fuzzykins is Eilahn's very-pregnant cat. Aunt Tessa is also a demon summoner and has a shop in town. Carl is her boyfriend who works as a morgue tech at the coroner's office.Ryan Kristoff is an overlay that imprisons Lord Szerain, the oathbreaking demonic lord. He's also an FBI agent living, with Zack, in Kara's house with whom Kara is in love. Right along with Mzatal. Zack Garner, a.k.a., Zakaar, is Szerain's demahnk demon bodyguard, guardian, and an FBI agent as well. He's also Jillian's baby-daddy and Rhyzkahl's ptarl. Jillian Faciane is Kara's best friend, a CSI tech, and eight-months pregnant.Lord Mzatal is the demon lord who rescued Kara in Touch of the Demon , 5. He also created the essence blades for himself, Rhyzkahl, and Szerain. Mzatal carries Khatur. Gestamar is his essence-bound reyza. Ilana is his ptarl, a demahnk advisor. Steeev is another syraza demon who will become Jill's bodyguard. Jekki and Faruk are a mated pair of small, blue faas demons who love to take care of people. Three of the illius demons who make Mzatal's palace their home include Wuki, Dakdak, and Tata.Idris Palatino is a human summoner who chose to become Mzatal's apprentice; Kara has her suspicions about his origins. Amber Gavin and Rose Palatino are his sisters; Angela and Jerome are his parents.Lord Elofir is Mzatal's lone ally, a true pacifist. Greeyer is his ptarl. Michelle Clelland is with Elofir after she was almost a victim of the Symbol Man in Mark of the Demon , 1. Elinor was a summoner working with Szerain who laid waste the demon world. Giovanni was her lover.Beaulac PDDetectives Vincent Pellini and Marcel Boudreaux are with Violent Crimes and major pains. For some reason, Pellini is nice in this, and it has Kara worried. Baxter is a crime scene tech. Dr. Lanza is the coroner's office pathologist. Corey Crawford was Kara's boss.The bad demon lords, the Mraztur, include:Lord Rhyzkahl is the betraying one who seduced Kara; Xahn is his essence blade. Kehlirik and Pyrenth are some of his reyza.Lord Kadir, a.k.a., Creepshow, is crazy-mad and dangerous. He also likes to hunt and torture people, but he also adheres to the rules. Helori is an Elder syraza and Kadir's ptarl who helped Kara heal. Lord Jesral and Lord Amkir, a.k.a., King of the Assholes, are Rhyzkahl's allies in wanting to take over the world.Isumo Katashi, the first summoner of the twentieth century, had been Mzatal's marked summoner but has been a traitorous ally to the Mraztur most of this time. Tsuneo is his senior summoner and is marked by Jesral. Tito is a student and a thug. Gina Hallsworth is another summoner.Rasha Hassan Jalal al-Khouri is a summoner who was married to Sapar. Jade is her granddaughter. Mystery Man Twenty-two, a.k.a., Aaron Asher, was one of Rasha's students and is now working with Katashi.James Macklin Farouche, a.k.a., Big Mack, is a local boy with his own arcane powers who made good with a variety of companies including StarFire Security and a reputation for philanthropy. Angus McDunn is his personal bodyguard. Carter, Charles Clancy, and Sonny Hernandez are more of his security. Sonny is/was also one of Paul's handlers, a man Bryce saved, and with his own touch of calm. Hanson is an accountant, Stevens is an in-house financial advisor, Aberdeen is a surveillance specialist, and Hennie's a great cook. All with the ability to sense the arcane. Nigel Fox is a top man as is Jerry Steiner, who is also a sadistic prick.Bryce Thatcher is part of Farouche's security team. He's bodyguarding a computer genius with an ability to sense the arcane, Paul Ortiz, and they've bonded.There are eleven qaztahl , demonic lords, and their job is to maintain the plexus that holds their world together after Szerain's actions almost destroyed it. Vahl, Vrizar, and Rayst are the others not involved. Demahnk are an elder syraza. Illius are the equivalent of arcane vultures who feed on stray essence from dead or dying creatures. Zrila are clever and very creative.The grove is a network that connects the lands of the demon lords and a magical entity on its own. A nexus is a focal point of power; it can supercharge rituals done on top of it. If Kara can master all eleven rings of the shikvihr ritual (each ring has eleven sigils), it means Kara will be able to use floaters, floating sigils, that eliminate the need for chalk or blood drawings. Faster means a better chance of survival.The CoverThe cover is scary with Kara under siege in her sexy black dress, a gleaming essence blade in hand and her sigils all alight as she waits behind a demon wing in the midst of a fiery battle against a misty gray background at Larouche's place.The title is all about about Mzatal and his Fury of the Demon as he battles the four demon lords.",4.0,"Full of laughter, magic, and not as much tension as I'd'a liked...",1405123200.0,"07 12, 2014"

It is handy to carry, and having the cables attached means not losing them - not a bad idea at all.It arrived with about half a full charge, and took about an hour to top off.This is a nicely packaged portable battery for recharging phones and other such items. It has a pair of cables attached, one for some Apple products, one micro USB.Since I'm not a fan or user of Apple products, I can't comment on its usefulness for any of those. I also do not have any inductive (wireless) charging pads, so I can't test how well it works with those. It did inspire me to look into those chargers and see how efficient they are, as inductance can be fairly lossy. (I do have an inductively charged toothbrush, and that seems to work well, albeit slowly).If you like the piano black style finish on your tech toys, you will like this. It is about 3.5 inches square and  of an inch thick.

These kinds of items are very handy to have around in today's world of rechargeable everything.I am not fond of the indicator lights that display charging status - they seem a bit cheesy and the copper button over them seems cheap.Also, the micro USB plug did not fit my Samsung phone easily, so I wonder about the quality of that. It took a bit of fiddling to get it to make contact, and,while it did recharge my phone, the indicator on my phone didn't show it s status properly, and the indicators on the charger were not useful in that either.Not great, but not bad either.

A1NDMIBMK5R2KG,B0002A2VQE,Scott D. Gribble,"[3, 3]","Let me start by saying I haven't been following the career of Masta Ace.  Although I know all about him and have only heard good things, besides his verse on ""Symphony"" I had never actually heard him.  I had herd a lot of hype about Disposable Arts & Long Hot Summer and yet passed on both.  Finally after being very skeptical, a friend made me listen to Good Ol' Love, and from there I decided to give the album & Ace a shot.I had very high expectations for this album, almost trying to find faults in it before I even started listening to end, but before long things changed.  I realized what an amazing album this was.  First It's one of the few Hip-Hop concept albums that actually works, the skits and the songs weave together to create a cohesive story, at the same time the songs by themselves do not depend on the story.  I won't comment on the storyline of the album, you'll have to see how it all fits. (Don't miss out on track 22, which is actually outtakes from the skits on the album).Because of the concept album idea, every song is different in it's own way.  In fact, I feel getting too in depth in the descriptions of the song would spoil your listening experience; I'll give some brief descriptions.  ""Good Ol' Love"" uses a soul sample, as Ace reveals he only wants respect and love from his fans (how does 9th Wonder continue to get better, this song is one of his best production credits yet).  Ace proclaims he won't give up on the ""H.O.O.D."", which uses a sped-up soul sample.  ""F.A.Y."" is a take on 2pac's ""F*** The World"" from an underground rappers view.  ""Beautiful"" has Ace reflecting on life finding the things that are just that.  ""Bklyn Masala"" is a love story, while ""Travelocity"" is a comical look on groupies rappers meet on tour.  ""The Ways"" is practically dedicated to Suge Knight, revealing how violence is the way to get your way in music industry.  ""Wutuwankno"", is a question and answer session for Ace to speak on issues in his career.  ""Soda & Soap"" is actually a concept song within the concept album (how great is that).  ""Oh My God"" is Ace's underground party track with an infectious Beatnuts flute loop.  Big Noyd shows up for the grimy ""Do It Man"", which gives insight to the tales of violent shootouts.  ""Big City"", speaks on life in New York and ""Da Grind"" is a somber encouraging track for anybody doing their daily work to make money, the piano and violins are perfect fits on the production.  The album ends with ""Revelations"", which uses an acoustic guitar, as Ace gets poetic.  It's a final say on his career and life passing on knowledge before he rides of into the sunset.This album is filled with great lyrics, tons of quotables and great production.  The album covers a variety of subject, styles, and meanings.  If I could point out any fault whatsoever, it would be that after you know the story you'll be wanted to skip around to get to the tracks.  But certainly that's no price to pay at all for the creativity of the album.The bottom line: this album surpassed my expectations in everyway and has not left my deck for three weeks.  It's highly enjoyable to listen to, yet also is thought provoking, as well as clever lyrically.  The production is stellar, that album structure is practically perfect.  I can say by experience, this is not just for a Masta Ace fan, this album cannot be denied by anyone who loves Hip-Hop music.  I almost slept on this album - don't make that mistake.  Long Hot Summer reminds of why I like Hip-Hop in the first place. (9.5/10)",5.0,"""A song like this in these days and times is beautiful""",1096502400.0,"09 30, 2004"

I love that I can stream movies and shows through Amazon Instant Video and Netflix on my TV now, thanks to my PS3 system. The only thing I wasn't too happy about was that it only came with one controller, but that was easily enough fixed with buying another one separately.

The graphics are great and the many things unique to the game are to brag about. But I'm not too crazy about killing other people in video games, and this isn't just a zombie game. Yes, the other people are trying to kill you, but I'm still not a big fan of it. It almost rivals Resident Evil, but I'd take Resident Evil over this game any day. It does have a kind of occasional puzzle, but it's really too realistic for me, I guess. And it would be awesome if this game was more than one-player off-line, but it isn't.

This game is rated Mature, and not to be taken lightly.

A1GCFR0B1AMXJU,B0043EW354,Terry Rocks,"[0, 1]","We had a Eureka Boss for about 10 years which had several attachments broke but the main vacuum was fine. I bought it based on CR rating as the best at the time (Eureka Boss is still close to top today too) and I thought 10 years ago that $179 was not cheap when I could have gotten a $100 dirt devil but went with the ratings.My wife has been ""hinting"" that we need a new vacuum for a couple of years which I kind of ignored as  A: the Boss worked fine still for carpet and B: We have 2 (big and small) shop vac's for the needed ""attachment"" type cleaning.I would never in a million freakin years spend over $200 let alone $300 on a vacuum. I have known all about Dyson's for years and have heard all the raves. I attribute this to the likes of those those ""Apple Zombie"" types. My wife's grandmother raves about by her Dyson yet I think she was just ""foolish"" to waste that much money on a vacuum....or so I thought....So on Black Friday I am relaxing and playing with the kids (have never and will never go shopping on this day as it is rest and Christmas light day). I was checking my e-mail and got a ""Black Friday"" e-mail from Sams Club. One of several ""featured items"" was a DC33 for $249 plus free shipping. Now I have not been able to figure out what my wife wants for Christmas because she does not tell me (or as a man I just forget those hints over the year) so I thought bam! that was easy. I placed the order and told her (yea early surprise). She was shocked I did it knowing my ""cheapness"" but very thankful....gosh we have been married too long where a vacuum brings joy.So it gets delivered and I try it out. We are in a brand new home as of April with hard wood floors in all living areas and brand new Armstrong Smart Strand carpet only in the bedrooms. We have a strict no shoe policy in the house, no animals, and my wife vaccums at least twice a week so the bedroom carpet is very clean...so I thought! We did one bedroom and I was ""SHOCKED"" at how much crap the Dyson pulled out of the carpet that was just vacuumed the day before. I mean like half a canister of dirty, dusty, linty, crap!By the second room we had to empty the canister WOW! Not only did it pull nasty stuff out of my kids carpets but the carpet felt different...like brand new when it was installed 7 months ago...We have high quality Smart Strand but I had not realized how it lost its smooth and sheeny feel which the Dyson replaced.Next a high pile area rug bought from IKEA in July that was already getting matted down. These are made of Olefin so I assumed the matted was from the everyday vacuuming and the fibers slowly melting from heat friction. WOW the Dyson got a whole canister of crap from that rug and it is no longer matted.Bottom Line! BUY A DYSON!! I would pay full retail knowing what I know now if I had to do it all over again! That says a lot for me plus I don't often write reviews! Their COMMERCIAL is dead on..""If it says it works like a Dyson...it is not a Dyson! I actually thought that any vacuum is just as good and Dyson that was is all HYPE! The Eureka Boss is still a top rated contender for cleaning....uh um yea...look at the Dyson canister after the Boss does several runs and that is all I need to know!This company builds quality and it is clear! Plus it has great features and ""design"" ideas that are very god and practical...like a 35 foot cord, like no hard snap to unlock the top and bottom half to cleaning(just gently push down with your foot and you are ready...now my kids can vacuum as they could not unlock the Boss) and so much more....love the hand tool LONG! hose with recoil and the fact it is in the handle...we can now reach 10 foot high spots like air vents that we had to ""lift"" all three of our old vacuums up to....and someone actually complained about this feature..come on!As for the bad reviews.....people are morons! Yes it is hard to push but the light weight makes up for that (at least vs the Boss / beast the Dyson is much easier for us) I can see that a Dirt Devil / Orek type user would hate this as it does dig in and is hard to push BUT!!! the reason it is hard to push however is good? because it is actually doing its job....digging in and sucking the crap that the easy to push vacs leave!If you want a clean house and clean carpet BUY THIS! 5 Year Warranty Included vs 1 Year With Others..DONE!

A1S1JC7LTBZAH2,6303560067,Hal Jordan,"[1, 1]","When most people think of Barbara Stanwyck and Fred MacMurray they think of the great noir classic, ""Double Indemnity.""  Not too many people are aware of this film that the pair made four years earlier.  Now while I am giving this movie five stars, I have to admit that it is not in the same league as ""Double Indemnity,"" which to my mind is one of the best films ever made.  ""Remember the Night"" is an excellent Christmas film that deserves to be much better known.  The script by the brilliant Preston Sturges is outstanding, MacMurray shows the easy charm that he was to employ to such great effect decades later in the TV series ""My Three Sons,"" and Stanwyck displays a winsomeness that is very appealing.Although this film is not as obviously Christmasy as Stanwyck's ""Christmas in Connecticut,"" which she filmed a few years later, in some ways the scenes at MacMurray's family farm in Indiana do a better job of conveying the true meaning of Christmas.  MacMurray and Stanwyck's drive from New York City to Indiana also does an excellent job of showing the United States as it was on the eve of World War II.  The film's main drawbacks are that the plot is a bit implausible and Sturges apparently couldn't resist including a stereotypical African-American servant part.  The actor who plays MacMurray's ""house boy"" Rufus is billed as ""Snowflake""!  Leaving those issues aside, if you are a fan of the stars and like 1930s/1940s Christmas films, you will almost certainly enjoy this film.I purchased this DVD through Amazon, so it is a apparently a DVD-R, rather than a regular pressed DVD.

Since most of the English words have multiple different meanings, a rough conservative estimation results in three quarters of a billion definitions of entries and sub-entries. One literally needs a train for schlepping these tomes, let alone purchase and transportation expenses.Hence it seems unrealistic of some previous reviewers to expect of a 5-ounce and 35K entries dictionary, to present all the rare words of the English language. Metaphorically speaking: as if one expects to win the Monte-Carlo car races with his modest family car.In spite of above facts, this 4th edition dictionary (ISBN 978-076456147) is surprisingly rich for its size. Just opening the book at random on pages 262-3, are listed uncommon words for the casual English reader as: ""pusillanimous""; ""purview""; ""quadriplegia""; ""purulent"". The entries definitions are clear and accurate, consisting of one to few words, including the most common manifold meanings. There are entries of slang, some idioms and words as ""schlepping"" adopted from foreign languages.This 5-ounce dictionary is a ""lifesaver"" for deciphering unfamiliar words found in any book or articles, when the unabridged dictionary isn't handy, as while traveling back and forth to work. Due to its lightweight and compactness, this pocket dictionary is always handy, nesting in my bag or pocket; one just can in minutes of leisure browse and gain a more sophisticated vocabulary. On top of that it rarely failed me in finding and clarifying the misunderstood word;probably it has to do with the clever choice of headwords in this featherweight dictionary.",5.0,"""Accurate, reliable, lightweight dictionary on the go""",1327968000.0,"01 31, 2012"
A1OGXR0166Q0XJ,1594850577,"Fritz R. Ward ""dayhiker""","[12, 12]","Ever since the publication of Thomas Kuhn's 'Structure of Scientific Revolutions' science history has been preoccupied with changing paradigms and social influence upon scientific thought.  This focus has offered many benefits, but a decided negative is that there are fewer traditional biographies of significant but forgotten scientists.  This short volume by Dean Littlepage is an exception to the rule.  A throwback to an older style of historiography, it is an excellent account of the life and contributions of Georg Steller, the first naturalist to write an account of the Northwestern Pacific Coast.Georg Steller was a German naturalist, a predecessor of Linneaus, and a member of the early Russian expeditions to map the Pacific coast of North America.  Steller was a multi-talented product of the Enlightenment.  He spoke several languages and received formal training in theology, medicine, and biology.  After teaching in Germany for a short stint, he moved to Russia and joined the newly formed Russian Academy of Science.  He joined Captain Bering (for whom the Bering strait is named) and in a visit to Kayak Island began the first scientific exploration of the Northwest.  But Steller was much more than just a talented naturalist (he collected 140 specimens in a mere 6 hours on Kayak Island.)  He was also an extraordinary physician who correctly hypothesized that a diet heavy in green vegetables would fend of scurvy centuries before the discovery of vitamin C.  His scientific background ultimately saved the crew of the St. Peter, Bering's ship, in the face of disaster.  The challenges facing the crew shipwrecked for the winter are truly gripping and it is hard to put the book down as Littlepage recounts this period.This book makes a for a fascinating read.  The author not only notes the breadth of Steller's scientific discoveries, but traces the fates of the animals he wrote about in his best known work 'Beasts of the Sea.'  Many were nearly hunted to extinction while environmental changes threaten others.  The Steller Sea Cow is now extinct and all that remains is Seller's description.  In all, this makes for a wonderful book.  I highly recommend it to anyone interested in reading some traditional science history with profound implications for today's world.",5.0,Science History at its Best,1165795200.0,"12 11, 2006"

It is a pretty cool idea, and I do enjoy having freshly ground coffee;  It is very attractive and stylish - gets rave comments from guests;  the coffee does stay fresh and hot, which is a huge plus for me.  Overall, it does make a great cup of coffee.Now, the cons.  It is messy, and requires that you deal with the damp, fine grounds that seems to end up everywhere; it is tough to clean areas that can't be removed; I end up forgoing the grinder feature more often than not, due to the mess that I don't have time in the morning to deal with.  It is not just a matter of throwing the removable pieces in the dishwasher - the whole interior is gunky.  Also, the only way to see how much water you have added is to peek INSIDE the back of the machine - there isn't an external gauge of any sort - kind of a hassle, especially if you aren't making a full pot.As far as ""overflow"" - this happened a few times to me, and in my case, I realized that I had forgotten to completly empty the carafe from the prior use - sounds crazy, but since it is thermal, you can't see it and can forget that there are still a few cups leftover.  (Especially in the early morning...)  Then, of course, it overflows.  Took me awhile to figure this mystery out!Also, in the last 6 months or so, our carafe has begun to leak terribly.  So bad, that when I pour a cup of coffee, I have to do it over the sink otherwise I would be mopping up every morning.  I'm positive I am using the lid correctly, as it has been fine up to now.  It is time to replace either the carafe (at $40) or replace the machine, and I believe I will be getting something different....looking at the ""Coffee on Demand"" by cuisinart - same fresh, hot coffee feature without the thermal carafe design flaws.

The radio reception is tricky, but the quality is high.  The software may be a  bit annoying to work with, but I've found that Real Jukebox is a perfectly  viable alternative for transferring songs.  The voice recorder is a  definite perk, the magnesium casing is very durable, and the LCD display is  very nice, to say the least.  The size is nothing to complain about either,  as it is small and fits perfectly into even the smallest pockets.  I do  have some complaints, though.  First of all, the headphones it comes with  are very poor.  And I must agree, the software is just plain user  unfriendly, and the parallel port connection is a bit sluggish.

A1MJMYLRTZ76ZX,6305807043,magellan,"[0, 2]","I just had a few miscellaneous comments on this very unusual film. I'm usually easily entertained when it comes to movies, because I don't usually expect very much of them (at least the stuff that normally comes out of Hollywood as compared to various independent directors). It's rare that I really rave about a film, but I have to admit I was impressed with how original and unusual this film was. A lot of films are pretty predictable, but this one isn't, and the film had me wondering what kind of wacky and funny hijinx or scene would come up next. But they did just that for the next two hours. The film also playfully explores some pretty profound questions relating to identity, consciousness, the afterlife, and so on. And on top of that there's a kinky scene or two that are pretty over the top just by themselves.Given all the above, I would have to count this as one of the more intelligent, unusual, and funny movies to come out in recent memory. I was a little surprised it had even been produced and come out of Hollywood rather than by an independent director, but shortly after I'd seen the film I heard a brief interview on PBS with the scriptwriter and he said the same thing, that he was surprised when the script was picked up and the studio actually decided to make the film.Also, it's great to see Orson Bean is still working, and actually, I thought he looked pretty good for his age in the movie. I remember from the old days when he appeared on the Johnny Carson show and he called himself a ""humorist"" rather than a comedian. Well, I'm not sure really what the difference is between humor and comedy, but this movie certainly has them both in spades and it was very obvious he had a lot of fun making the movie too.I very rarely rent movies that I've seen in the theater and see them twice, but I plan on renting this one and watching it again soon, since I haven't seen it since it first came out five years ago. Overall, a very unusual, outrageous, and entertaining film that I suspect will become a cult classic.",5.0,A few comments,1097366400.0,"10 10, 2004"

He addresses all of the events in his life directly and doesn't shy away from addressing even the most painful episodes. His description of growing up in the Kennedy household as its youngest member is so engaging that I felt as though I was in the room with the whole family. He provides seemingly small but totally appropriate accounts and conversations of the day to day life in the Kennedy family. He also discusses how his family's beliefs and expectations framed his thinking as a young man and propelled him towards taking the path of having a 'serious life' in public service.Although diagnosed with the devastating illness of terminal cancer, Ted Kennedy is given the opportunity that his brothers did not get, the chance to accumulate his thoughts and memories and write about his life- truly a remarkable gift to leave behind. He takes this mission seriously and inimately discusses both the tragedies and triumphs of his life. What struck me most while reading Kennedy's description of events from the Depression to the Clinton years and the election of Barack Obama was that this man was basically involved in every major event that happened in our country in the past 80 years! And so he was.Some of the most touching and well-written depictons in the book (among many) were his memories of his oldest two siblings Joe Jr. and Kathleen, memorable horse-back riding trips with his father, his time at Harvard and the army, his relationships and interactions with both JFK and Bobby-with whom he was especially close- the unimaginable pain he felt after their deaths, the fascinating adventures he had as a freshman senators, dealing with his son's bone cancer, surgery, and recovery, his 1980 presidential campaign, and most especially, meeting the love of his life Vicki, her children, and the transformative effect that love has had had on him.The book is truly a gem, and one feels privileged that Kennedy has taken the time and effort to chronicle his memorable life. I will say that I found accounts of his family life with his brothers and sisters, children, and Vicki far more interesting than some of the day to day interactions that took place in the Senate. However, Kennedy was a Senate man, and his memory and understanding of the workings of the United States Senate is impeccable. While he certainly enjoyed the recreational activity of sailing as a favorite past-time, he was an unbelieveably hard-working senator and a dedicated public servant. His was a life worth chronicling.",5.0,A Thorough and Intimate Account of a Memorable Life,1253491200.0,"09 21, 2009"

Admittedly, because of the many negative and mixed reviews, I had my doubts on the quality of the case, but since I didn't like any of the alternatives, I went ahead and purchased it.I've been using my Palm on a daily base for a month now. During this period, I've dropped it around 5 times, once in a stream of water in a roadside. Not a scratch on the PDA, it looks exactly as it did on the day it arrived.Despite my best efforts, I am careless and forgetful (hence the need for a PDA), thus I find this case to be perfect for my needs.CLARIFICATION. Many of the mixed or negative reviews here are from people that haven't learned to use the case properly. As another reviewer pointed out, the hard case has a hinge that matches with a slot on the PDA, a perfect fit. The PDA doesn't flop or shake around at all. The cover is most definitely NOT made of plastic, but some type of aluminum. The inside is plastic, and has 2 slots for memory cards.Opening the case is extremely simple and takes 2 to 3 seconds: you hold the case in your palm, top cover facing outward, press the bottom lid in (there's a small triangle that indicates exactly where) with your thumb, the case then clicks open, you then use your free hand to open the lid (which rotates 360), swing the PDA and pull the stylus out and voil&agrave; ... brand new Tungsten E. I hardly ever use the power button to the unit on since I have 4 alternate power keys on the front.By the way, you do NOT need to pull the PDA out to charge or hot-sync it, I do it daily and haven't had to do this once. On the other hand, as one reviewer pointed out, you won't be able to listen to mp3s while the case is closed. Is this important? There are excellent mp3 players out there, with up to 30 GB storage, so I find buying expensive memory to play mp3s on your PDA ridiculous.For it's elegant appearance, slim fit, unequaled protection, and relatively cheap price (on Amazon) this case deserves 5 stars.",5.0,Unequaled protection in an elegant package,1074211200.0,"01 16, 2004"

For $13, I wasn't going to pass up on that deal - comparable to other 3-in-1 lenses out there, this one seemed reasonable for the price. It's quite versatile (as an iPhone user) - I could use this clip with a thin phone case and place it over my front camera (won't work on any thick case like Otterbox defender series). Also, I used this on my MacBook Air's web camera - just played around with it on Photobooth and it was pretty neat! There are the four corners that are visible on the fisheye lens which is an actual effect for that lens. IMO, I like it. People will think otherwise.You get what you pay for.

It is not precisely cheap and some people have complain about focusing problems with this product. I decided to go for it and I could not be happier. It is an excellent lens.Pros:-The optic is excellent. Color rendition, contrast, focus accuracy is as good as it gets.-Silent focus (I don't think it is faster than non SDM lenses, but it's much more quite and that's a delight!)-Construction wise is really sturdy and the fact that is weather sealed is a plus.-The focusing ring does not turn when the auto focus is engaged.-Manual/Auto focus clutch is easy to slide, plus you have the ""Quick Shift Focus"" mechanism of all Pentax DA lenses.Cons/room to improve- Minimum focus distance (1 Meter/ 3.3 foot) There's definitely room for improvement!!- Focal length is a little short, but you should weight if it would be a problem or not for you. (A 50-150mm would have been nice).- Lens is a tad heavy and does not have a tripod collar like its counter part Tokina!(not that I need a tripod collar, but it would have been a nice add on)All in all an excellent performance and excellent value for the price.

AAA532X8MG7A7,B00097DXZS,D-to-the-A,"[0, 0]","[...]Anyway, on to the review of the CD: On first listen I was a little dissappointed, considering that the CD is about 20 minutes shorter than Santana's other collaborative offerings, but on repeated listens I find it to be awesome!The first 2 tracks, ""Hermes"" and ""El Fuego"" are classic Santana at its finest, and a great way to kick off the album.I can't get enough of lead single ""I'm Feeling You"" featuring Michelle Branch and her new band The Wreckers and find it to be slightly better even than ""Game of Love"" from Shaman.  As lead reviewer said with Shaman, ""Game of Love"" was the pop song of 2002, with no help from Carlos himself.  Well, the same could be said for ""I'm Feeling You"" in 2005 except that Pop seems to have its head stuck so far up its a$$ that it fails to recognize it, as it's having trouble breaking #40 on most pop charts.  It does seem to be doing well on VH1 and Adult Contemporary Radio, though.Moving along, ""My Man"" is a great infusion of soul from Mary J. Blige, and a little rap from Big Boi (his 2 raps, underlied by Santana solos, are really the only time true rap appears on the whole CD).  The song reaches an amazing conclusion as Mary J. combines her best ad-libs with Santana's searing licks.Aerosmith frontman Steven Tyler appears on the next track, ""Just Feel Better,"" and the result is what ""Don't Wanna Miss A Thing"" or ""Fly Away From Here"" might be like if they contained Santana solos.  This one took a little while to grow on me, but just like the slower Aerosmith songs, it soon became one of my faves.  Still, it's one of the weaker songs on the CD.Will.i.am channels the spirit of funk bands like Earth Wind and Fire and P-Funk for the next number ""I Am Somebody.""  The result is a very pepped-up, funky number with plenty of hooks, and 4 Santana solos just serve to spice it up even more!Next, the guests finally get an intermission for the more classic track ""Con Santana.""  Several reviewers are saying he's big-headed for naming a song about himself, and that might be the case, but it's nothing new.  He has a few album titles which feature his name and the instrumental ""Santana Jam"" to his credit even before the 1999 comeback.  The song?  If you like classic Santana you will like it.Moving on, we come to the longest song on the CD: the Anthony Hamilton collabo ""Twisted,"" which is most like Shaman's ""Sideways"" by Citizen Cope, in that it's the folkiest song on the CD.  But this song has a little more Santana and a little less guest than ""Sideways.""  It's good, but about as weak as ""Just Feel Better,"" but like it grows on you.""Trinity,"" the next song, is not at all what I expected, since it contains renowned Metallica guitarist Kirk Hammett and Pedal Steel virtuoso Robert Randolph.  I expected that Santana's trademark solos would be surrounded by a combination of thrashing riffs and gentle twang, making for a very unique number.  However, in reality the licks played by the three sound very much the same!  In the end, the song is a great instrumental and serves well as a bridge to the next song.Caribbean sensation Sean Paul and British soul princess Joss Stone may seem mismatched in the next track, ""Cry Baby Cry,"" but with Santana's solos the whole thing works very well together.Next is ""Brown Skinned Girl"" from American Idol finalist Bo Bice.  Every time I listen to this song, I think it has the greatest potential to be this album's ""Smooth,"" as the chorus has a similar feeling to that song or Rob Thomas's solo effort ""Lonely No More.""  A great track with plenty of Santana soloing.Pentultimately is the album's true gem, ""I Don't Wanna Lose Your Love"" the match made in Heaven with Los Lonely Boys.  This song is incredible and seems to remind me of ""Why Don't You and I"" from Shaman, but it is truthfully unique and near perfect!The album ends as it begins with classic Santana and the song ""Da Tu Amor.""  This is a great track that even gets jazzy toward the end.  ""Oye Como Va"" 2005, anyone?Finally, this album may not have the impact of Supernatural, but it deserves to have more impact than Shaman.  Pick it up for yourself, but be careful, as there might still be a few bad copies with the rootkit out there.  &iexcl;Viva Santana!",5.0,"Well, I guess this means I can play it on my computer, hee hee!",1132012800.0,"11 15, 2005"

The band is fairly typical of the Inside Out label, solid mainstream progressive rock that occasionally borders on metal.

It is about a humanitarian, Gabriel, who is captured by a post war north Vietnamese radical group. Oppose to what would really happen, a SEAL team sent to rescue her. It is decided that former Marine and Nam veteran (Micheal) will be contracted by the father of Gabriel whom is a millionaire. Micheal's character working in a correctional facility demands that he gets to take some of those prisoners with him and those who survive the mission get a full pardon.The movie seems like it wasn't thought out and was directed by someone who knew very little about the military and procedure. One small thing i noticed was Micheal's character is a former Marine yet the officer whom comes with Gabriel's father is in the uniform of a Army officer. While it is possible they did serve side by side in Nam it is unlikely that he would've be in direct command of Marine units which intern would be Micheal. That is one little thing i noticed about the film and how it delivered the story.This movie seems like someone watched The Dirty Dozen and decided to make a remake with a change in plot and setting.

A3ABPSWQZDPHI7,B008E20HAE,"Jessie Potts ""@BookTaster""","[0, 0]","After reading the first book in the Wayne County Wolves series, I was surprised to see another Lost Shifter book out so soon (surprised but happy).  The last half of the series have been a hit or a slight hit and with a $4.99 price tag you are gambling each time.  North's Complications was a hit for me.  Ever since the Christmas story where we saw Dominic take control of finding a Christmas tree I had to know his story.  North is also a bit of an enigma since Shane visits him as does Keegan and well half the coalition.So...Pros- I really liked their love story.  They didn't fall into bed right away and since they're from previous books the love wasn't that instantaneous 'you are my mate now lets fall in love' feeling that some of Hecht's couples can have (Wayne County Wolves)- I liked that there was action and violence.  I know I reiterate this every time but I really think it gives the novellas depth when there is actual fighting and readers can see more of this war, while there wasn't a huge amount of violence (Shane yum) there was enough to wet my appetite- We get to see more women in this book, I know that's a weird thing to say but up until Dulla came in, the series was saturated with men and then Cassie.  Now we have Dulla, Dominic's girls, Ava (love her!) Hana and a few others.Cons- Ava was a bit too adult, though she's a leopard and grew up in a training facility, I did love that we got to see a full scene with just her and Dominic in it, but I would also like to see a bit more of her leopard side since the foundation (not all) of Shane's reputation is that he's a psycho because he's a leopard- Shane... this is hard to put down into words but I love Shane and I actually loved how crazy and mean he was.  While I understood and even supported the need for Shane to grow into something more human, I really don't want him to become superficially crazy.  He talks all the time of bringing home kills and heads and never does, he talks about wanting to kill people but then is unsure because of Trevor, he's visiting a shrink but still destroys his office or so we hear but never see... I don't know I just don't want him to get too soft because part of his draw as a character is that he's not soft.  I want to see him bring a head home, even if it's to scare a prisoner, I want to see him rip a head off, not just talk about itThose were my only two gripes, and they weren't really gripes... well that and the price tag but it's the dang publishing company's fault not the author's.  All in all I still adore the shifter series.  It makes me happy to read and I like seeing the evolution of the characters.  I would love to see more of the original characters, maybe do some second books on Andrew, Owen, Dean, Daniel, etc, instead of throwing them all together for a Christmas special, but I also always adore meeting new couples... speaking of which when will we get to see Tatum and Ackley??",4.0,I thoroughly enjoyed it,1342915200.0,"07 22, 2012"

ATEAV0U4S494V,006172680X,Shannon Naugle,"[0, 0]","Lauren Oliver is such a great writer.  If it wasn't for her great writing, I would not have enjoyed this book nearly as much.  Samantha Kingston (Sam) is your typical ""mean girl"".  She has clawed her way into the upper echelon of high school and now is a part of the popular clique.  She is not a likeable character.  She has little regard for others feelings and makes fun of people without a thought.  She is not one-dimensional though.  She isn't mean just to be mean or to fulfill an archetype.  It is more that since little affects her from her top position she just has no idea how harmful her actions are.  This is the crux of the book.  Sam dies in a car accident, only to wake up the next day to relive it all over.  Each relived day she makes different decisions and the outcome always changes.  Finally she starts figuring out what she needs to do in order to ""make things right"".On one hand, since she isn't a likeable character, so she can only improve, right?  But even at the end, I felt like she could have come a lot farther.  Maybe it isn't realistic to believe that someone could change that much in a week, but I just wanted...more.  I wanted to learn more about the other characters and how Sam went from being a nobody to being an ""It"" girl.  Also, I felt like you really don't start seeing any redeeming qualities in her friends until the very end.  This frustrated me a bit because it made them pretty one dimensional right up until at the end.This story in the hands of a less accomplished writer would have fallen flat.  But Oliver gives her protagonist a strong and clear voice.  And seeing how Sam's actions change the day's events is really interesting.  I found the book over all to be a little melancholy, but since it is about Sam's death it makes sense.

Just getting a new Vita Mix I am all set to go and was getting rather bored with my same old same old fruit and veggie blends.First let me say the book I received has a different cover than the one shown, this may be because I am reviewing for the Vine Program. The shake shown here is in the book with the picture you see.The book is very high quality glossy paper with the kind of covers I love on paperbacks it has strong flaps that can keep your place. The organization of the book health wise is what makes it stand out from other smoothie books. The chapters are divided by what you are wanting to strengthen or work on. For instance. Energy Enhancers, Wellness Blends, Antioxidants all the way, Kid-Licious, Probotic power. Just to name a few. There are over 60 different blends.It uses a lot of whole foods which I love. Some of the fruits are not available in my town but if you live close to a whole foods store or large farmers market you will have no problem. It's only a few rare items, almost everything you should have at the local grocery. My first taste was Blueberry brain boost.....sooooo good. Blueberries, banana, raspberries and it called for walnuts but I am allergic so I made mine with pecans. It makes 2 servings and tastes like you are cheating on a diet not the truth it is good for your health.I cannot wait to try each and every one. I may have to do like the movie Julie and Julia and have one a day until I do the whole book.You also get some education on each grouping on the importance of each group for good health. Nothing heavy just enough to encourage you to want to take the time to do something good for yourself.I give this book the highest Praise. I have looked at quite a few smoothie books and found them lacking and full of stuff I never heard of or couldn't afford.

AIQ4L11KA2IUT,B00E2277Z8,"MrLopez2681 ""MrLopez2681""","[1, 1]","Starting with his first recording of ballet music, the 1962 LP ""The Art of the Prima Ballerina"", the renowned conductor Richard Bonynge pioneered recording important yet obscure ballet music so often neglected from recorded performance. For his 1964 follow up to ""The Art of the Prima Ballerina"", Bonynge chose to record an album devoted to the classical pas de deux. ""Pas de deux"" was first re-issued on CD in 1992 as part of the Decca/London label's 8 CD ""Ballet Gala"" series released from 1992 through 1995, though all of the discs were out-of-print by the end of the 1990's. In 2001 the Decca/London label compiled most of Bonynge's recordings of rare ballet music that were featured in the ""Ballet Gala"" series for the 10 CD boxed-set""Fte du Ballet: A Compendium of Ballet Rarities"".The first piece presented in this suite is the Grand pas de deux taken from Petipa's 1869 ballet ""Don Quixote"". The music was composed by Ludwig Minkus (1826-1917), who from 1871 until 1886 held the post of Ballet Composer to the St. Petersburg Imperial Theates. The ""Don Quixote"" Grand pas de deux - so famous and well-known today - was originally a Pas de quatre. The music offered here is in an arrangement by Peter March. His arrangements are adequate though not very interesting. His treatment of the so-called ""Fan variation"" (the familiar variation for Kitri) is awful - it was originally arranged for solo harp, but March gives the melody to an out-of-place flute. This famous variation was actually written by Riccardo Drigo (1846-1930) for Mathilde Kschessinskaya when she danced in Alexander Gorsky's 1902 staging of ""Don Quixote"" at the Mariinsky Theatre. Interestingly, Kitri's original variation for the Grand Pas was set to music featuring a violin solo that is no longer performed.Next is the so-called ""Blue Bird Pas de deux"" from the 3rd Act of Petipa's 1890 ballet ""The Sleeping Beauty"", set to Tchaikovsky's magnificent music. For the most part Bonynge conducts the music exactly as it would be for the stage.Another Tchaikovsky number follows, this time the Grand Pas de Deux from the 1892 ballet ""The Nutcracker"". Bonynge does a fine job conducting as does the orchestra playing but, as with the inclusion of the ""Blue Bird Pas de Deux"", I find this a useless addition to this recording, being that there are literally hundreds of different recordings of Tchaikovsky's ballets. Bonynge's conducting is first rate, but unfortunately the allegro coda of the famous ""Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy"" is cut.For the 4th selection we have an excerpt from Joseph Mazilier's 1846 ballet ""Paquita"". The piece offered here is taken from Petipa's 1881 revival of the work, for which the Ballet Master added new numbers to music by Ludwig Minkus. Among these pieces was a new Grand pas classique for the last act that soon became a popular concert piece in its own right. Unfortunately we have, yet again, another tedious re-orchestration of Minkus's music. The origins of this particular arrangement are interesting - it seems that for decades the only  material available outside of Soviet Russia of Minkus's ""Paquita"" Grand pas classique was of a version prepared for the touring company of Anna Pavlova. The musician responsible for this orchestration is not known by me, though it was likely one of Pavlova's musical directors. Peter March later expanded on this arrangement, and that is what is offered here by Bonynge. Pavlova often performed the ""Paquita"" Grand pas classique with only one variation, just as Petipa had originally staged it. Interpolated here is an additional variation, presumably for the male cavalier, that was originally composed for a female dancer! The music is not by Minkus but by the Alexei Papkov, long-time conductor of the St. Petersburg Imperial Theatre's ballet orchestra. Bonynge made a second recording of the ""Paquita"" Grand pas classique in 1988 for thedouble CD titled ""Ballet Gala"".The next pas de deux is perhaps the most rare piece included in this entire suite. It is the so-called ""La Esmeralda"" Pas de deux, which in recent years has become a popular piece on the gala and competition circuit. I have seen many young danseuses performing the horrifically tacky ""tambourine variation"" from this pas de deux at ballet competitions, and nearly all of them use this recording as accompaniment. ""La Esmeralda"" was originally created by Jules Perrot at Her Majesty's Theatre in London in 1844 to the music of Cesare Pugni (1802-1870). The ballet was staged for many opera houses throughout Europe, the most important being Perrot's 1848 staging in St. Petersburg where he would soon be engaged as Ballet Master. ""La Esmeralda"" was revived many times after by Petipa once he succeeded Perrot. Though he staged his final revival of the ballet in 1899 for Mathilde Kschessinskaya, his more or less definitive version of the ballet was mounted for the visiting italian ballerina Virginia Zucchi in 1886. Though Petipa is often credited as the author of this pas de deux, it was actually Pyotr Gusev (1904-1987) who created it. Gusev is very important in the annals of ballet history. Trained in St. Petersburg, he would go on to become Ballet Master of both the Kirov and Maly companies in Leningrad. Among his most lasting (though often uncredited) contributions to the ballet repertory was the creation of several pas de deux cobbled together from shreds of music and choreography taken from Petipa's full-length ballets without much rhyme or reason or any concern with musical integrity. ""The Talisman pas de deux"", ""Harlequinade pas de deux"" and ""La Esmeralda pas de deux"" were among many of these odd confections. In the case of this ""La Esmeralda pas de deux"", we have an entr&eacute;e and adage taken from Petipa's 1887 ""L'ordre du Roi"", a female variation taken from Luigi Manzotti's 1878 ballet ""Sieba"", and a coda taken from Cesare Pugni's score for Petipa's 1862 ""The Pharaoh's Daughter"". The male variation is the only piece taken from ""La Esmeralda"", and is an odd choice indeed for a male solo - it was originally composed by Pugni to accompany a famous scene called ""Rverie"" from act I/scene 2 of the ballet, where the heroine Esmeralda spells out her beloved Captain Phoebus's name with large cut-out letters! The music recorded here by Bonynge for ""La Esmeralda pas de deux"" is again presented in a re-orchestration by Peter March, likely do to the fact that this music was only available outside of Russia in a piano reduction at the time this recording was made. With regards to choreography, the traditional version of this piece is by the choreographer Ben Stevenson. It was created for the dancers Janie Parker and William Pizzuto when they entered the International Ballet Competition in Jackson, Mississippi in 1982. Note - there is another, far superior recording of this pas de deux included on a disc titled""The Ballerinas""in an orchestration by John Lanchbery.The following pas de deux is known in the world of ballet simply as ""Grand Pas Classique"". The music comes from Daniel Auber's opera-ballet ""Le Dieu et la Bayadere"" and his ballet ""Marco Spada"". The dance sections for this work were choreographed by Filippo Taglioni for his daughter, the legendary Marie. In 1949 the choreographer Victor Gsovsky extracted various pieces from Auber's score for the pas de deux recorded here, and proceeded to choreograph a wonderfully academic and flashy piece for the Ballerina Yvette Chauvire and the Danseur Vladimir Skouratov. The pas has since become a show-piece danced by many companies around the world. Bonynge handles the music well for the most part.Thanks to Knud Arne Jurgensen's wonderful article ""Is the Flower Festival Pas de Deux by Bournonville and Paulli?"" from the Autumn 1994 issue of Dance Research, I have been able to learn that the so-called ""Flower Festival at Genzano Pas de deux"" is just as much a pastiche of sources as most of the pas de deux which make up today's popular ballet repertory. Its true origins lay in an 1856 staging at the Karnthnerthor Theatre in Vienna of Bournonville's 1842 ballet ""Napoli"". For this production, the dancer Lorenzo Vienna - who performed the principal male role of Gennaro - created a pas de deux for the third act to new music by the Austrian composer Matthias Strebinger (1807-1874). Bournonville apparently liked the piece so much that he added it to his 1858 ballet ""The Flower Festival at Genzano"", and the composer of that work, Holger Simon Pauli (1810-1891) adapted Strebinger's music accordingly for the new staging. Since Pauli composed the score for ""The Flower Festival at Genzano"", a score which also included music by Eduard Helsted (1816-1900), the music for the ""Flower Festival at Genzano Pas de Deux"" has often been credited to one or both composers in modern programs, films, etc. The next composer to have a substantial hand in this piece is Adolphe Adam (1803-1856), who is certainly responsible for the music of the male variation in triple time. This piece is actually taken from his score for Joseph Mazilier's ballet ""Le Diable &agrave; quatre"", staged for Carlotta Grisi at the old Paris Op&eacute;ra in 1845. Just how exactly Adam's variation ended up in this pas de deux is mystery to me. Bonynge does a fabulous job with the music for this piece, with the orchestra playing the music exactly as it would be for the stage.The final track is the so-called ""Le Corsaire Pas de Deux"", in an orchestration by John Lanchbery (1923-2003), the conductor/composer who achieved notoriety in the ballet world with his controversial adaptations of Minkus's scores. This famous Pas de deux has a colorful and complicated history which has nothing to do with Petipa, the choreographer so often credited with its creation. ""Le Corsaire"" had its premiere in 1856 at the Th&eacute;tre de l'Acad&eacute;mie Imp&eacute;rial de Musique, and was brought to the Imperial Ballet of St. Petersburg by the Balletmaster Jules Perrot in 1858 (with assistance from Marius Petipa), where it became, and remained, one of the most popular works in all the repertory. Marius Petipa revived the ballet on several occasions during his long career, his last revival being in 1899 for Pierina Legnani. ""Le Corsaire"" was given a new production at the Mariinsky Theatre in 1915. For the occasion a new Pas d'action was created by the Ballet Master Samuil Andrianov (noted teacher of the young Balanchine). This is the number we now call ""Le Corsaire Pas de Deux"", though it was originally staged as a Pas d'action for 3 dancers (as in modern stagings of the full-length work), and was first danced by Tamara Karsavina as Medora, Andrianov as Conrad, and Mikhail Obukhov as an additional suitor (the suitor would be later be replaced in Soviet times by a new character known as the ""Rhab"", Russian for slave. Pyotr Gusev's 1955 revival for the Maly Theatre in Leningrad would name this character Ali, and give him a more prominent role in the rest of the ballet). Although modern programs and films almost always credit the music for ""Le Corsaire Pas de Deux"" to either Adolphe Adam or Riccardo Drigo. Though Drigo is the author of most of the music, the pas was not composed as a unit - it became increasingly common in the early 20th century to create a pas de deux to a pastiche of music, and ""Le Corsaire Pas de Deux"" is a case in point: the opening adage is a nocturne by Drigo titled ""Dreams of Spring"", originally composed for piano. The male variation was taken from Petipa's 1870 ballet ""Trilby"", having been composed by Drigo ad hoc, perhaps for a long-lost pas de deux. The female solo included here is the composer Anton Simon's (1850-1916) ""Souvenir du bal"" for solo violin, traditionally associated with the so-called ""Dryad Queen"" in the dream scene of the ballet ""Don Quixote"". The coda is from a custom-made pas de deux by Drigo that was written in 1895 for Petipa's ballet ""Pygmalion, ou la Statue de Chypre"".With regards to choreography, the 1915 'Pas d'action' went through a galaxy of revisions in Soviet times - it was Agrippina Vaganova who turned the piece into a duet in 1931 for the graduation performance of Natalia Dudinskaya, partnered by Konstantin Sergeyev, thus transforming it into a pas de deux. The male dancing went through changes throughout the 1930s and 40s by the great virtuoso danseur Vakhtang Chabukiani, who added in much of the male dancer's famous athletic elements (it was throughout this time that the suitor became the Rhab, and thus the choreography changed even more).Rudolf Nureyev staged ""Le Corsaire Pas de deux"" for the first time in the west in 1961 for himself and Margot Fonteyn (the cover sleeve of the original LP release of this recording has a picture of Nureyev and Fonteyn dancing ""Le Corsaire Pas de Deux""). For his staging, Nureyev had the ""original"" music orchestrated by the Royal Opera House conductor John Lanchbery (1923-2003), likely because the only manuscript of the score available in the west at that time was of a piano reduction. Nureyev had performed ""Le Corsaire Pas de Deux"" for the first time in Russia in 1958 with Alla Sizova for their graduation performance (there is a famous film of this performance). For her performance, Sizova substituted the traditional variation in polka time for Anton Simon's ""Souvenir du bal"", which found fame in the ballet world when Alexander Gorsky used it in 1902 as a solo for the Dryad Queen in his revival of Petipa's ""Don Quixote"". Nureyev would utilize this variation for Fonteyn when he staged ""Le Corsaire Pas de deux"" in 1961, perhaps because it better suited Fonteyn.Bonynge does a wonderful job conducting, particularly in the opening adage. I would much rather hear this pas de deux in its original orchestration, but its seems it is only the Mariinsky Theatre that has any of this music in its bonafide original arrangement. Lanchbery's orchestrations are pretentious and overly bombastic in some sections, particularly in the adagio and male variation. The female variation is almost completely untouched by Lanchbery, while his arrangement of the coda is over-the-top, making one's teeth hurt by the amount of sugar one gets from the orchestra. Nevertheless, Lanchbery's orchestration of this music has become very iconic in the world of ballet, particularly with its association with Fonteyn and Nureyev.Eloquence Australia has also re-issued Bonynge's albums ""The Art of the Prima Ballerina"" and ""Homage to Pavlova"".

Moving from Suburbia to the heart of the Bronx in the early '70's just before adolescence, Ms. Maxfield explains in a way reminiscent of David Sedaris, the burgeoning multitude of behavioral absurdities of each of her family members from every increasingly bizarre angle during her teenage years.

A134TCTK1FZF2V,1937254550,Sandy @ Craving YA Reads,"[0, 0]","Phoenix attends a boarding school where the one rule is no one is allowed in the school itself after curfew.  She doesn't know why until she falls asleep and wakes up at night - only to find students who she has never seen before, who have a fetish - for her.  Well, not her specifically, but more for her flesh.Kate Evangelista doesn't do her Zombies the way of 'Dearly Departed' or 'Warm Bodies' though.  She did them in a way that was quite intriguing and which blended history, science, survival and, yes, romance together.The setting of this book was quite interesting - even though it was set at a boarding school, which sadly I feel is becoming very cliche, this was different.  Maybe it was because it had been based under the school more than actually in the classrooms - which is where the story truly lied.The world-building of the Zhamvy people was done quite well.  There are two factions - the Royal family and the government.  But there are also conflicts between two families of the royal family as well.  It tells the history of the Zhamvy, how the royal family had become divided and also how, in the end, two royal cousins worked together to stop something terrible from happening to their, and the human, race.  The sad thing about the Zhamvy people is that they are a race that are slowly dying and Phoenix, being human, holds the key.The pitch is actually misleading.  It kind of indicates a love triangle, but I didn't feel there was one.  Phoenix very clearly only had feelings for one guy, and only considered the other one a friend.  I won't mention names because I consider that to be a spoiler.  You'll just have to read it yourself to see if you come to the same conclusion.I will say that this book does have its own little jealousies running amok among the characters.  It was quite amusing, even if annoyingly obvious in how things were going to work out.I enjoyed the characters.  Phoenix was a girl who was grieving for her mother, while being ignored by her dad.  She seemed to be in a state of hurt and confusion over her father's actions, and it showed in her relationships at school.  She was obsessively determined to find out what killed her mother and in that way she reminded me of Dray, another character.Usually, especially if there's some kind of love triangle involved, I favor one boy over another, but I loved both Demetri and Luka.  They both had traits that had me favoring the both of them.  And I have to mention Dray again.  He was the one who, I felt, tied everything all together.  He was, in his own way, the savior of his kind.Anyway, enough on the story and characters, there was something I noticed that I felt I should mention.  The book needs to be proofread again.  I found a couple of mistakes while I was reading it - one on the first page.  I'm no grammar expert by any means, but these were obvious - even to me.'The tolls yanked me from my seated position to my feet like a pair of rough hands'  - This to me is an incomplete sentence, plus punctuation is missing at the end.'They finally caught you didn't they.' - Incorrect punctuation - should be a comma between 'you' and 'didn't' plus a question mark at the end.I didn't note any others because I wanted to enjoy the story, but having an error on the first page does set the book up to be torn down - especially if the reader is a grammar nazi.  If it was distracting to me, it would be worse for them.On the whole, though, this was an enjoyable read.

A19PV1OH8RBVX8,1484893964,"Jessica Loves Books ""Blogger""","[2, 2]","The best word I can think of to describe this book is immature. The main female character came across as immature, naive, whiny, and weak. I wasn't able to connect with her at all. The writing style of Rucy Ban also came across as immature. By that I mean that there was potential there, but it just hasn't developed fully yet. This could have been a very interesting and entertaining book, but it just fell so short.Several situation in the book came across as unrealistic and unbelievable. For instance, the main character, Karri, was videotaped by the teenage jerk that she lost her virginity to. Then he blackmails her for money every week, holding the threat of releasing the video over her hear. But instead of her asking for help - whether it be from her mom, her friends, the police, or even just a friendly teacher at school, she ducks her head and suffers through paying him every week, instead of doing something about it. She is just too much of a victim for me.And then in swoops her guardian angel, a.k.a. Neil Mars who quickly becomes the love of her life. I found this very unbelievable considering the trauma that she has been through, and the walls that she has put up around herself. He breaks them down astonishingly easily and quickly has Karri wrapped around his finger. Admittedly, he does turn out to be the good guys (too good to believe), but it just didn't work with what we had seen of Karri's personality so far.The whole situation becomes even more unbelievable when we find out who Neil really is. (view spoiler)But the ending just takes the cake. It is super rushed, super unbelievable, and laughably contrived. All of the books problems are solved in a couple of paragraphs, and then the resolution of the story is shoved into a woefully short epilogue. It was just poorly executed.Overall, there was potential in this story but it just fell too short. I had to make myself finish reading it, and I never connected with any of the characters. They were all very superficially written, and there was so much bad inner dialogue and inane conversation that I just couldn't go there.

AGM4K9JRDZXX6,0784010188,Matthew D. Davis,"[5, 5]","SKYNET EDITIONThis movie is unbelievably amazing on Blu-ray disc.  The picture quality and sound quality is superb and for it's age, I do  not think this movie could possibly look any better.  The skynet edition is interesting.  We get 3 versions of the film.  The theatrical, director's cut, and the extended director's cut which is un-lockable with a password and has an alternate ending.  The alternate ending can also be watched separately in the special features so I would recommend watching the regular director's cut since the alternate ending in the extended is not linear with the rest of the franchise and it's sequels.  Although the ending is interesting and worth a look.  As far as special features go, there are not as many as the ultimate edition dvd had but there are still many including BD live features that I have not had the chance to check out yet as I do not have my bluray player hooked up online.I do have some cons with the features.  Many of the features like the behind the scenes stuff are in a picture-in-picture format.  This means you have to be watching the film to view these.  While this is an interesting take on commentary because we not only hear them talking about it, we actually see it, this is not something that appeals to me.  I have never been a commentary guy.  I rarely listen to commentaries and for me to have to watch the whole movie just to watch some behind the scenes stuff does not appeal to me.  Some people might feel the exact opposite.  I personally would rather have a behind the scenes featurette.  The games are also played while the film is playing.  As a matter of fact pretty much all the special features require you to watch the film.  This is why it is over 8 hours worth of special features, because you have to literally watch the film 4 times with each feature turned on.  I do not know what the BD live features are, but I hope to get connected soon to find out.Another issue I have with this disc is the load time.  It takes several minutes to get to a screen that says you are not connected to skynet, you may watch this disc without being connected click here to do so...  something to that effect.  You then have to click that you want to watch the film.  When that part comes on, I go make some popcorn or something because the screen is blank for at least 5 minutes.  It is slightly annoying and I have to really want to watch the movie to go through that ordeal which makes the skynet edition slightly less appealing.  However every player is different and some work much faster.  Also I do not know if hooking it up online would help.  At least it wouldn't be searching for skynet so it is a possibility.Even with the extremely long load times I recommend this blu-ray because it is the best version of T2 available.  T2 isn't a movie you throw on to pass the time, you put it on to experience.  Throw it in, let it load and go make some popcorn.  By the time your done the menus will be loaded and you can pick 1 of 3 different versions to watch.  Sit back and enjoy T2 in 1080p HD with complete master audio!

ABBMZBVAPAJI5,B000067A3M,Critical,"[13, 17]","I have played EQ and EQII for over 4 years.  If you buy this game be prepared to download many patches to it.  If you are a road warrior and have a slow dial-up connection, expect a 2-3 day download. Yes I mean 2-3 days not hours.  The game does not specify but recommends you have high speed bandwidth...In the past, Sony has issued new versions or extensions for EQ I, but they have not done so for EQ II.I recently re-installed EQ II on a computer with a cable modem with a download speed past 512 KBPS, it took more than 20 minutes to download all the patches after the EQ II application connected...this does not include the time you spent installing 10 CD's before this happens.Sony has made many changes to the game.  EQ 1 players will think they understand it at first...but there is no incentive to group or join a guild until you have played the game for several months.  The focus has been to allow the solo player to advance, perhaps to compete with WOW...this isn't bad...but as an EQ1 player I felt lonely many times.  Guilds and groups don't have the loyalty you felt in EQ1.If you decide to create an Evil character...be forwarned...On the server I played on there was a tiny fraction of people playing as there were in the ""good"" city.  The NPC's in the city normally insult you. They try to coerce you to perform quests by using intimidating or insulting remarks when you ask...at first it is cute, after all you are a (supposedly) evil person (sic), but most folks don't like it after a few rounds of hearing it...that may explain why the betrayal quests...i.e a person leaving one faction for the other are so one-sided (evil folks wanting to become good)Although having insulting NPC's is the flavor of an evil city, no one wants to hear it all the time. In EQ 1 the NPC's were nicer and glad to see you if you originated there.Furthermore, it was nearly impossible to find a balanced group n Freeport (the Evil City).  And, there were never any items fit to buy that were crafted by players.  Since the game designers felt it necessary to make tradeskills so important, it is odd that in the evil city, you'd be better off wearing things you found looting dead monsters  The bazaar is empty in Freeport...probably because people don't want to be insulted continuously when they live there.If you have the right hardware, the game has slick graphics and is easy on the eyes.  Game play is fast past level 1 through 15 or so...at levels 29-30 the game is a real drag as a solo player...if you want fast progresssion here, you will need to group with others in a dungeon.  I loved the game thru this point when I could play it.  After level 25 as a solo player...it was a slog.As to social things...Many of my toons belonged to various guilds, but the Guilds never seemed to do anything like organized raids, or group together to help a guild memeber.  Mostly they wanted to build a high membership count and force their members to accept city quests (tasks so hard that they required a group to fullfill) to build up their 'guild' score, but almost never did the guild leaders organize anything or anyone to help me finish these.  After many minutes begging for help on Guild Chat, I normally found that the guild leadership had left it up to us to find non-guilded players - unwitting participants, to fill a quest that the guild would get a credit score for...In EQ I, you'd never see this happen...Overall I think this is a good game.  The graphics are great, Sony has included Guild web sites and management tools that the guild need not pay for at their own expense.  You can even manage a guild wthout being logged into the game as a player.My biggest complaint is the unreasonable expectation that no matter where you are you will have high speed bandwidth accesss to install the game and download the patches which seem to be larger than the original game files.  If you payed 50 bucks for a game, you wouldn't expect that it would launch a dialogue box that says ""You will need 20-30 minutes on a high-speed connection after you install all 10 game disks before you can play Everquest II""...Sony expects bleeding-edge technology.  A 128mb or better Video card, 1 GB of ram (or more) and a fast CPU with a high-speed bandwidth connection seems to be the norm...anything less and you'll pay a price in game performance.  These things aren't cheap...if you add the cost of the hardware and the high-speed connection to the monthly fee..you won't be playing this game if you're relatively poor.Finally, a note on the guilds and group psychology.. It is completely blown here...with the later emphasis on allowing folks to solo, somehow, the flavor of EQ is lost..I don't know where it went..but many times in this version of EQ, you will feel as if you are quite alone...",4.0,Dial-Up Customers Beware,1123200000.0,"08 5, 2005"

Tossing and turning on such turbulent seas, I have been hankering for a safe harbor of understanding from which I can chart a more productive course. I have found it in Psychiatric Rehabilitation, a wonderful textbook by Carlos Pratt, et.al. at University of Medicine and Dentristry of New Jersey, one of the few schools which actually teaches this subject at a graduate level. (Boston University and University of Illinois at Chicago are the other two.)Psychiatric rehabilitation is a relatively new field within mental health. Originated by early adopters like William Anthony of Boston University and Robert Drake of Dartmouth Medical School, psychiatric rehabilitation proposes to turn the traditional concepts of mental illness on their heads. No longer are we talking illness and disability. We are now all about wellness and recovery. This makes perfect sense. As a cancer survivor myself, I appreciate an affirmative tone that this book projects... confidence... autonomy... VICTORY over affliction! The old thinking is about disability, illness, limits, constraints, restraints, disability... The new thinking, so well embodied in Pratt et.al.'s fine text, is all about empowerment, hope, recovery, POSSIBILITIES!Psychiatric Rehabilitation describes it all well. For a loved one of someone with a mental illness, this book is a godsend. It speaks of the wonderful potentialities for all mentally afflicted to create a better life for themselves in their recoveries. All recoveries will differ. They all depend on the individual. Families also play a critical role. The beauty of this book is its laying out so lucidly all the possible elements of a holistic recovery, supported employment, supported education, and supported housing, just to mention three.Never would I wish a mental illness on anyone. My son's PACT director says that mental illness is an ailment worse than cancer. At least with cancer there is a definitive end. I don't go that far. My son's mental illness, I tell my incredulous friends, has actually been a blessing: I have come to learn first-hand of the significant trauma that many loved ones navigating this maelstrom experience for themselves. The blessing is in the bonding with all of them. It is part of the spirit that Psychiatric Rehabilitation embraces.This text lays out cogently, simply, articulately all the aspects of recovery available to our disabled. Its plain and direct explanations can help the afflicted--and their loved ones alike--to see ahead a better future. Psychiatric Rehabiliation, both this text and the movement it describes, is all about positive empowerment.

In the face of incredible beauty and incredible hardship, our words fall flat and collapse into painful habits.  But Jill's don't.  They bring to life what alone stands as a fantastic journey.  It's hard to imagine pushing oneself to one's mental and physical limit every day for three or maybe even four weeks.  It's hard to imagine being able to do this if one were in a perfect state of mental and physical readiness leading up to the race.  But I can't imagine what it takes to pull this kind of effort out of shambles and devastation.  I loved this story for the exhausted, snowy night-time slogs, for the quiet moments of mountain exaltation, for the confusing relationships, and even more for the revelation that comes from it all: that this race was not something to finish before starting anew, but rather that the race itself was a new beginning - of something brave and strong.

McIntosh ""Jonathan""","[7, 11]","Generally thought this book was a good overview of the US Empire's economic imperialism and how it functions using debt, banks, governments and corporations. Perkins provides an interesting inside look at these institutions, which I have not come across before.However there are a few points in the book that I had issues with.First: Perkins clings to the belief that the US can be the world's savor; fixing all the problems it helped to create. In this respect he comes off a bit arrogant, replicating the ""American white men can solve all the problems in the world"" attitude. Certainly though reparations for Empire's destruction are in order, but how that should happen, I think, should be up to people in the effected areas and not up to the Empire itself.Second: while Perkins points out many of the US backed coups, assassinations and massacres around the world, he somehow misses the 1965/1966 US role Indonesia. Odd since this was one of the first nations he worked in as an EHM. Perkins maintains the dubious US official line of a PKI (communist party) coup attempt in Jakarta, even though there is ample evidence of direct and indirect US involvement in setting up and backing the brutal regime of General Suharto (1967-1998). Edward S. Herman and Noam Chomsky have some good work on this in the book, The Washington Connection and Third World Fascism.The book also does not offer much in the way of alternatives or actions for the public to take.

I guess a similar storyline has been done before (from what I've read), but I had never seen anything like it so I enjoyed what was, to me, a fresh take.

But even though these translations always go on, many don't think about it. Nornes' book is a new view of cinema because it researches this important problem.

A11PKVBGCKRVEK,0385511809,"Keith Otis Edwards ""Keith Otis Edwards""","[42, 54]","I easily got through Saturday by Ian McEwan by using the technique of reading every other page. Didn't miss a thing.The story is insubstantial. It's the events of 24-hour period in the life of a neurosurgeon, Perowne. Perhaps the device of a day's events compressed into a book is derived from Ulysses, or maybe from the American violence-entertainment 24. At first, nothing happens. The doctor, looking out of his bedroom window thinks he sees a comet, but instead (implausibly) it turns out to be an airliner on fire. Apparently McEwan couldn't think of what to do with that story line, so the book merely rambles on with reminiscences and ruminations for page after page. The story takes place in 2003, so there is much discussion of America's rush to go to war, on one hand, but then a superfluous character, an Iraqi intellectual who had been tortured by Saddam's Baathists, is introduced to provide balance. This story line also goes nowhere, and the novel has much else that is likewise thrown in.About halfway through the book, something does happen. Perowne is involved in a minor traffic accident with a car full of thugs who briefly play cat-and-mouse with him. This is abruptly resolved in an unrealistic manner, and Perowne goes off to play squash with his anesthetist friend. There are pages and pages of pointless description of the game, the high point of which is a minor disagreement over a score.The doctor's wife and children are introduced and their stories are told in flashback. None of it is at all realistic; the son is a blues-guitar musician, and the names of famous English blues imitators are bandied about. The fact that Perowne's progeny turned out completely different despite an identical upbringing is adduced as evidence that parenting makes little difference when compared with one's genetic fate. (This might be a startling and even controversial fact to someone who just awoke from the '60s.)Finally, the trio of thugs returns to invade a family reunion at the good doctor's house. Had this occurred earlier in the novel it might have been effective, but by this point I just didn't care. I cared even less when the lead hood makes the daughter strip naked by holding a knife to the mother. He then (and this is rich) orders the daughter to read aloud from her recently-published book of poetry, and when she does, the miscreant is so overwhelmed by its profound beauty and truth, that he decides not to ransack the home! Ah! The power of poetry!Now it's time to throw the irony on with a coal shovel. Although the crisis is apparently resolved, the blues-guitar-genius son jumps the ruffian from behind and throws him down a flight of stairs, which results in a severe concussion. The police are summoned, the thug is carried out on a stretcher, and the reunion resumes. But, Wait! Omigawd! The brain surgeon normally on duty that night is not available and Perowne must himself perform an operation to save the thug's life! Woah! Irony can't get much heavier than that, can it?Now, how can it be that the most prestigious journals in the Christendom have given such drivel deliriously ecstatic encomia?  Simple. This novel is exactly what one would expect in a piece of literature. As mentioned, we have the stream of consciousness as in Ulysses, and we have the excessive description typical of Steinbeck and the rumination of Dreiser and the dullness of Henry James. Therefore, this is aht! What's more, the views presented are exactly the truisms to which the average upper-middle-class reader already subscribes: there are many facets to consider in world events, but many war protesters lack such knowledge and are simply rebelling; friends can occasionally be disappointing; thugs and bullies are bad.There is simply nothing controversial in this book and not even a new idea. Just as when people turn on the radio, they want to hear something familiar, and just as when they open a menu at a restaurant they want to see a list of familiar food, when they pick up a novel, they don't care to be assaulted by anything to which their thinking is unaccustomed. Had the neurosurgeon instead given the thug a lobotomy (in an early chapter) and then gone on a revenge-killing spree, the book would've been far more interesting, but all right-thinking reviewers would have been outraged and begun howls of protest. No Booker Prize that way. As it is, the doctor is utterly admirable --your mom would like him-- a quiet hero who eventually perseveres, but alas, this is about as realistic as James Bond.This tome (it's only 304 pages, but it really seems longer -- much longer) is also genuine literature because there's no fun it it and nothing clever. There is, however, at least one unintended yuk. In the daughter's poem, a simile describes a phallus as ""like the spout of a watering can."" (Those may not be the exact words, but I'm trying to purge the thing from my memory.) Imagine my surprise to discover that in the endpapers, Dr. McEwan credits another writer with this poem.

Comparing the neon polka dotted outbreak to the Black Plague in Europe, Wilmer is convinced he will have the winning entry for the science prize at year end: foiling his archenemy Claudius Dill.With clever illustrations and a simplistic yet wholly correctly plotted series of experiments and steps to determine the cause, Fowler DeWitt manages to make science approachable and interesting for young readers.  Wilmer's family adds the right touch of hilarity and parental ignorance, and the other students and school scenes being perfectly aligned to move the story forward and maintain interest.I giggled and was cheering Wilmer on as he collected his samples, muddled through the dinner hour at home, and postulated on possible causal agents.

A1W15ZSU1LUSDE,B0007PB0C0,Jormundgandr,"[3, 5]","I'll start off by saying this game is not for everyone.  If you buy this expecting the latest Warcraft ripoff in space you'll be disappointed.  If you buy this looking for in-depth tactical space combat, you're getting your money's worth.Gameplay is fully 3D, but maneuvering is made easy by simple commands and a competent AI.  A detailed loadout screen precedes every battle, with many options for each slot on your ship(s).  The battles themselves range from stealthy (and sometimes frustrating) sabotage missions to full out space battles between dozens of warships.  In an interesting design choice, ships move in a fairly realistic way.  Each ship has massive banks of retro thrusters to stop it, and turns using thrusters on the top and sides.The gameplay ranges from slow-paced tactical battles between pairs of light warships to large, fast-paced assaults.  The different sides are well balanced, largely because they mount very similar weapons.  I could have used a little more difference between races.  Missions are almost always long and rewarding; there are many different mission types throughout the game.Graphically the game is excellent, considering its 2004 release date.  Ships move with a real sense of mass and inertia, torpedoes and lasers fly, fighters weave, and artillery weapons produce truly spectacular explosions.  On my medium range system (running at 1024 with highest settings and anisotropic filtering) I only ran into slowdowns during the fiercest battles, but the framerate never dipped below playable rates.  The only problem with the graphics is the lack of an anti-aliasing option.The musical score is symphonic, which can be nice but is mostly hit or miss.  It is usually barely noticeable.  There is one excellent chanting track that plays in a couple of missions, but some of the music is downright annoying.My only real complaints about this game are the sometimes poor voice-acting and a tendency for missions to require multiple play-throughs.  I suppose it should be expected for a foreign-language import but the voice acting detracts from the cutscenes and mission briefings.  Some missions require fairly specific weapons loadouts -- the loading screen won't let you start without at least one of the weapons you'll need on at least one ship, but you can guess you'll need more than one of the correct weapons or shields to have a chance in the mission.",4.0,Good,1128988800.0,"10 11, 2005"

It was a must have like the Silver Mountain DVD (which Amazon didn't carry - so I ordered from the band directly) and Running Wild's CD/DVD live Wacken show. The good news is that the Pretty Maids is an all region DVD, just as the Silver Mountain comes in both formats. So unlike Running Wild, at least these other 2 bands thought enough about their fans all over the world to ensure the DVD could be viewable in the United States as well as in Europe. Especially as these bands aren't likely to be coming to a show near you.So how is the show? Well, they do look quite a bit older compared to when they first started, but they sound very good. I used to mourn the fact that Def Leppard went downhill after showing such promise on their debut. I don't care about that anymore. I've realized that the Pretty Maids fill that void perfectly: Great songs that show heaviness and melody and class - all without being wimpy. Most of the songs you'd expect are here: Back to Back, Future World, Red Hot and Heavy - I only wish they would've included Only in America, which is only their best song!!!

In this recording of the last three violin concertos by Henri Vieuxtemps', they stand on their own as the featured works,  They DO really stand alone as some very marvelous extreme romantic compositions. The concertos are filled with lush harmonies and soaring melodies. (I love the concerto #5 in A minor--its gorgeous!)Misha Keylin, the violinist is ""new"" to me; however, he plays with very beautiful tones through out this recording and he certainly is ""up to"" the extreme demands of these works delivering the virtuosity of the works wonderfully.  What impressed me very much is that no matter how demanding a part was he still managed to produce beautiful tones.  To me, Misha Keylin is a most impressive violinist; I look forward to hearing him often.The sound on this recording is great; it remains lovely through out its entirety never turning harsh.  Naxos has done a great job of recording these lush works.For some reason, I started this series at its end; however, I do intend to purchase the first two discs in this series.

John Mancini is an agent with the reputation of getting inside a criminal's mind and is chosen to lead this assignment. After reviewing the individual case files, his instincts tell him this is a master plan being played out and that only one person is abducting the women. He selects a team of four agents, one of whom is Agent Genna Snow. He believes that it will be Genna who will break the case by finding a missing piece of the puzzle. She has an uncanny sixth sense and seems to be able to instinctively feel and think like one of the victims.Genna and John share a past, one that John desires to rekindle. When he walked out of her life without a word, he left her shattered and feeling abandoned. An invitation to attend a baby's christening with his boisterous Italian family will reveal unknown facts to Genna, facts which begin to change her mind and open her heart again. They will have a second chance to find love as they work together to solve the mystery of the case they're working on. It's a case that allows John to learn the horror of Genna's past and help him understand her better, and also one to cause him great anxiety when he learns Genna could be the next target.Genna and John were introduced in the winning novel BROWN-EYED GIRL and now it's their turn to have their story revealed. While BROWN-EYED GIRL was a thriller-chiller type of story, VOICES CARRY is what I consider a true romantic suspense, with both elements being equal.Mariah Stewart offers much more than suspense and romance in this fictional work. She writes about parental abuse and child rape, but also shares how a foster-mother with a beautiful spirit changes a young girl's life by offering unconditional love and affection. This is a multi-plotted tale about good versus evil, where secondary characters play a major role and round out the story. One of the main points is the love story, but the thread of the mystery and the suspense in finding the criminal weaves throughout. Fans will swiftly turn pages to see if they have guessed correctly, and will be surprised with twists and turns along the way. Mariah Stewart is an author on the rise, destined to hit the best-seller list at any time. VOICES CARRY is an example of her creativity, and a title I highly recommend. I believe it will find a place on your keeper shelves, right along with her previous titles.Carol Carter as written for Under The Covers",5.0,An exciting story with equal parts romance and suspense,985219200.0,"03 22, 2001"

A35Y7MFHCMQSEO,1935067036,Young Mensan BookParade,"[6, 6]","This is an informative book that reads like getting advice from your mom - albeit a mom with a Ph.D. in gifted education.  It's conversational, full of stories by someone who's ""been there, done that"", and soothingly gives the idea that you won't damage your kids too much, no matter what you do, as long as you love them unconditionally and stay tuned in to them.The book has ten chapters, each focusing on a different social or emotional challenge that gifted kids may experience in the later elementary years and older.  Examples of chapters include: underachievement, anxiety, making friends, challenging authority, motivation, etc.  The author organizes each chapter around an experience she had with one of her three children (now adults), explores the underlying reasons and research behind that particular social or emotional challenge, provides strategies for dealing with it, and ends with an afterword written by the author's twenty-something child who was the focus of that chapter.I found it particularly fascinating to hear the perspectives of the author's children as they looked back on their own challenges and their parents' ways of guiding them.  One of the themes throughout the book is that people are who they are - even as children.  Some of the common tendencies of gifted kids (anxiety, perfectionism) will probably continue into adulthood.  Rather than trying to eliminate an innate tendency, the author advocates that parents help their children recognize, accept, and learn how to deal those tendencies - advice that adults who see these traits in themselves can also use.I would highly recommend the book to any parent who wants to understand more about social and emotional challenges in gifted kids.  While I wasn't a fan of the gimmicky title, the book itself is a gem to read, and to keep on your bookshelf for future reference.Reviewed by Mensan Ann K.",5.0,Engaging Read and Good Advice,1326758400.0,"01 17, 2012"

A1RN5T7T7BAUCF,178279235X,Marcus Baumgart,"[2, 2]","I have just finished reading Who is Killing the Great Capes of Heropa?, by that wizard of homage, Andrez Bergen. Here are some first thoughts on the novel, which I highly recommend for anyone who entertains a certain class of fond childhood memories, and wants a cracking good read.With this novel, Andrez Bergen takes us once more into the world of his dystopian future Melbourne, Australia - the last city on Earth. Melbourne is not a nice place to be, a polluted, dangerous and divided place labouring under totalitarian rule, where citizens are just as likely to be `disappeared' by the state as to succumb to some environmental hazard or crime. In contrast with Tobacco Stained Mountain Goat, which introduced the city, this time we visit fleetingly - most of our time in the novel will actually be spent hooked up to an IV drip and electrodes, with our consciousness lodged firmly in a virtual world called Heropa.The contrast between Heropa and Melbourne forms a vivid counterpoint in the novel. Where Melbourne is decaying, filthy and dying, perpetually steaming under an acid rain, the towers of Heropa positively gleam under cloudless skies. Think of a comic-book Manhattan of the 1930's, with elements of the 40's, 50's and occasionally the 60's woven in for good measure and all ramped up Gotham-city-wise. City newsrooms bustle and buzz, the pavements are awash with swarming crowds of busy inhabitants, everyone wears hats, the women wear gloves and fitted dresses, all manner of fabulous vintage vehicles and trams ply the roads and heroes and villains do daily battle among the towers to gain the upper hand.Heropa is a city filled with two classes of being: the Capes, who are heroes or villains - real people hooked in via remote link - and blandos, or phonies - apparently sentient humans who form the vast majority of the world's population. These are artificial people with a small `p' tattooed between their shoulder blades, and who go about their daily business as alternatively beneficiaries or victims of the struggle between the Capes.The Capes are the main event in the city, and their battles and stoushes frequently extinguish numerous blando lives and destroy much property, only to have everything snap back into place at the midnight `reset', ready for another day. The battles between the Capes are something of a ritualised affair; not so much in earnest as in a grand tradition of move and counter-move, the comic-book-like destruction staying within some predefined limits. That's the theory, at any rate.But something has gone wrong in Heropa. The reset has stopped working, and injury and damage are becoming permanent. For the first time, Capes are being killed - violently obliterated in Heropa, and left as brain-dead husks in Melbourne. The novel follows 15 year old protagonist and comic-book afficionado Jack, known in Heropa as the hero Southern Cross, as he weaves his way through the city, attempting with his fellow heroes (the Equalizers) to determine who is killing the great Capes of Heropa - while trying to avoid being killed themselves.Bergen does homage really well, with frequent twists and a deft touch, and his works positively hum with his child-like love and delight in comics, sci-fi and noir. The settings, vehicles, props and aesthetics of both Heropa and Melbourne create vivid new worlds for the reader, worlds that positively beg to be explored. I felt that we have only scratched the surface of these places, and I for one hope that Bergen is not done with them yet.The aesthetics of setting, props and costumes are compelling, lush and rich, but they would only form an empty stage set without an equally compelling study of character driving an investigative narrative. In this way, I think Bergen's real party trick, evident in all three of his novels to date, is to craft enduring and well-rounded, believable characters who come to matter to the reader. He always seems to avoid the danger of shallow caricature that one might be tempted to suspect accompanies the genres he mines so effectively. Bergen's characters have a ring of truth about them, and what happens to them seems to have real consequence to the reader.In this case, we get to know the young Jack from before he enters Heropa; we first spend time with him in Melbourne, a poignant and solitary existence, his family imprisoned by the state - where he wrings as much joy out of a cache of comic books as he can. We go with him as he is introduced into an adult world - albeit a strange, virtual world, where he wears a skin-tight costume and mask on his muscled virtual adult body. We follow Jack as he then finds companionship in an unexpected quarter, in such contrast to his solitary and neglected life in Melbourne - and we also get to know his fellow Equalizers as they emerge in the narrative as characters with hearts and minds, despite their flamboyant comic-book appearance.Without spoiling any of the fun, one of Bergen's most compelling ideas is elaborated through a sideways exploration of the nature of artificial intelligence. Can we fall in love with someone who is not real? What does it mean to be `real' anyway? Bergen brings something new to these staple questions of science fiction, making us care about characters even as we know them to be `fake'. The questions raised by this exploration remain tantalisingly unanswered, but there is much fertile ground to explore in future works.I liked Heropa, I liked Jack and I liked his companions. I enjoyed spending time with them, as much as I enjoyed spending time with the characters of Bergen's previous novels. There is something about a Bergen novel that makes it impossible to put down - I read Heropa in two sittings. As I said earlier, I sincerely hope that Bergen is not finished with these fictional worlds - there is much still to be explored, and I look forward to the next instalment.",5.0,Cracking good read from the wizard of homage,1380412800.0,"09 29, 2013"

We had also purchased a smaller guitar for our daughter, and he wanted to learn to play with her. I must admit, I wasn't expecting a lot from a $50 guitar, but the reviews were good, and I figured $50 was about right to pay when I didn't know if he would stick to playing or not. When the guitar arrived, I was pleasantly surprised. It is solid and well built with a beautiful tone. I also really like the masculine black finish that is really well done. My husband was able to easily tune it, and it seems to stay in tune very well. With the help of a ChordBuddy (that fits this guitar perfectly) he is really enjoying playing.

I've heard so much happy nostalgia for T&T; from fellow gamers that I thought it would be perfect for playing with my 6-year old daughter. But I can tell, just reading the rulebook (and you may say it's unfair of me to judge the game without even playing it first, but I've played enough rpg's like it that I think I know whereof I speak) that it's not for us.There's a lot of double and even triple-digit addition; combat boils down to a horserace to see whose die rolls add up quicker (there is one parenthetical comment on p. 121 - a 'principle of good play' - that probably actually makes the combat fun, but why is that parenthetical and not the core of the system?); and there's an overwhelming amount of text.There are so many free light-on-rules rpg's on the internet that have this beat. If you're looking for simple rules, consider Risus. If you're looking for Old School Revival (fantasy rpg's the way they used to be played) consider Redbox Hack or Old School Hack. If you're looking for some tactical combat, consider Legends of the Ancient World.

(What a difference)I noticed that due to the design of the rubber feet, it is possible for them to sort of ""roll out"" of their mountings if the unit is pushed on a counter. If a loose foot isn't recognized it could get lost or inadvertently tossed out. You need the feet because they isolate the vibration of the vacuum pump and keep everything quiet and I was missing a couple.I contacted Jarden Consumer Solutions about this, hoping I could get them to maybe throw a couple of feet into an envelope and shoot them to me. They were very responsive and (unfortunately) told me that the feet were not a spare parts item, but after getting some purchase information, offered to replace my FoodSaver if I would ship them the old one.This really wasn't the Deal of the Century for me, as I had to pack and ship my unit (at my expense) and wait for a replacement, and I really didn't need a new one since the one I had had such low miles. But I did so, and Jarden expedited the process and had a new one in my hands in a week. It also included an accessory vacuum dish and a few extra commodities, which was a nice bonus.The company could have gotten bogged down in minutiae trying to get a special parts order processed for me, and that would have been fine, but the fact that they wanted to be quick about a resolution, even though it was ultimately a more costly process, says a lot about their priorities.

A1HG2DOSBZEX4I,B000BW7QWW,Bryan A. Pfleeger,"[1, 2]",In the short lived Fox TV series Firefly Joss Whedon created an interesting new world 500 years in the future that was a mixture of outer space adventure and the post Civil War old West. He peopled this world with an interesting group of misfits who somehow became a family by Episode 14. In Serenity much of the family atmosphere disappears and we are left with a medium budget action film. This is not necessarily bad just different.The film starts about six months after the close of the series. River Tam (Summer Glau) has been broken out of a Government facility by her brother Simon (Sean Maher). River has unwittingly been turned into a weapon by the government but more frightenly she harbors a secret that has the potential to weaken the govenment itself. An assassin (Chiwetel Ejiofor) is sent to find her and bring her back at all costs.Without spoilers that is the premise of the film. The characters are all ther from the show but they have changed in the time between the show's cancellation and the film's release. The Captain (Nathan Fillion) has become darker and more withdrawn. I think that his character is now closer to Whedon's original vision of him in the pilot episode. Other characters are not used as much as some of the fans may have wished but this is a limited run time film with nine main characters.Whedon keeps the film running smoothly for its entire run time and the film looks more epic than the TV show ever could. As a side note the cinematography of Jack Green looks fantastic even though I enjoyed the work of David Boyd on the television show a little more with its rougher edged look. The music is now by David Newman and ids much more thematic than that of Greg Edmonson.I watched the two disc Collector's Edition. The picture and sound were almost perfect. There are two commentary tracks: one featuring the cast which is more anecdotal and a more technical commentary by Whedon himself. Also available are numerous featurettes; some outtakes and deleted and extended scenes.This may be one that appeals more to fans of the original series but the film stands on its own quite well.

You will live in the same town as your family, and your sister will be in charge of you at the convent.  The only difference is your family no longer visits you, your sister cannot recognize you as her sibling but now, coldly as a pupil, and you are only 17.  Welcome to the life of Mariette Baptiste.  Mariette in Ecstasy is a mysterious little book about life in a cloister.  Life that is tightly scheduled, ruled with dignity and authenticity to the Catholic faith.Upon the arrival of Mariette the Sisters are all aflutter while trying so diligently to stay focused on God.  To each Sister, Mariette evokes a different emotion; some see only her youthful beauty, and perhaps their own lost youth. Others see her as a menace to their well-oiled machine of contentment, and for the Sisters, who are fervently seeking God, see her as a gift sent to their cloister directly from God.  Mariette in time experiences Stigmata and is met with mixed responses from the Sisters.  Ron Hanson leaves the reader to decide for themselves if she indeed did have Stigmata, in addition to provoking the reader to examine questions of faith and miracles.This book is extremely engaging and well written, and I am confident the reader will find this book was well worth his or her time.",5.0,Excellent - Well worth your time.,1131148800.0,"11 5, 2005"

A1YZ3IJXI2J119,0595407684,"Reader Views ""Reviews, by readers, for readers""","[0, 0]","Reviewed by William E. Cooper for Reader Views (11/06)I have long been a reader of military history, particularly as it applies to the United States.  Roger Naylor has written a work of fiction that is premised on the realities of WWII era pilots and their operations, as well as interactions with one another.  His descriptions of the geography applicable to this element of the war put the reader right in the tent, the cafeteria, and certainly in the pilot's seat.  The differing personalities of the pilots, the need for having a team, and the leadership that applied to decision making are well articulated.Mr. Naylor's descriptions of aerial battles are excellent, as are the preparations the pilots engage in.  Their personal battles, as well as with one another, and often the elements, are woven into the story in a manner that requires the reader to just keep reading.  ""A Paper Statue"" really is a good book.  I found myself unwilling to put the book down.  I highly recommend it.

That is good--it will keep them busy.  For the rest of us the book is a good read and a two-fer.First, it is a good explanation of the phrase ""Genteel Tradition"" that you hear now and again but perhaps never got straight.  Santayana's metaphor of American culture (circa 1910) is the manly American will living in skyscrapers and the feminine American intellect living in the colonial mansion formed, by a not particularly happy, amalgam of Puritanism and transcendentalism.  It is the Genteel Tradition that lives in the colonial mansion.  Santayana's nuanced critique (actually a lecture give in California) of the Genteel Tradition is the first essay in this book and has provided thought for many other essays and critical works since.There are essays by four modern scholars discussing the Genteel Tradition.  I enjoyed these essays, particularly Seaton's who points out (this is the other half of the two-fer) that the culture wars are nothing new and can be seen in the early part of the last century.  The image of a clever sot like H.L. Mencken drinking bathtub gin in the `20's railing against prohibition and Puritanism in general is too funny.  According to Seaton it was the silliness of prohibition that put a stake into the heart of Puritanism in American.  It was probably a wooden stake, however, instead of the required silver one since Puritanism still has some life left.Anyway, read this book and, scholar or not, you will learn a lot about arguably America's greatest philosopher.",5.0,SANTAYANA STILL RELEVANT TODAY,1273363200.0,"05 9, 2010"

I haven't been a regular comics reader for a long time, but I will start to follow this series.My biggest issue with modern-day Marvel is the lack of originality -- all the writers are clearly all too enamored with playing with the well-worn action figures of their own youth rather than sit down and put forth creativity to make something new.  Runaways fits that bill nicely; a series that is firmly grounded in the Marvel Universe but without the annoying need to be tied into several other comics I have no desire to read / follow.  It was a fun, if quick, read, with fluid artwork that matches the tone and theme of the story perfectly.  Nothing flashy or particularly groundbreaking, except for the fact that I was able to enjoy the book without feeling like I was missing out on any part of the story.  This is what superhero comics used to be, before the grim and gritty realistic angst throttled the sense of wonder and excitement out of them.It is a story that is aimed at a younger readership, but I found the lack of adult oriented elements refreshing.  Runaways reminds me of the Marvel of my own youth, when it was The House of Ideas and not current The House of Mega-Crossover Retread.

The Hidden Tapes features rare, unreleased, and licensed tracks from as far as Japan and the former Yugoslavia. Most of the bands on this compilation recorded on 4-track tape in their bedroom studios while two of them went further to collaborate by sending tapes through the mail. The sounds on this record range from raw proto-industrial to naive danceable Belgradian new wave, to filmic synthesizer music to more complex, vocal-driven melodic synthpop. The Hidden Tapes presents songs from Danton's Voice, Oskarova Fobija, The Fast Set, Sympathy Nervous, Pas De Deux, Unovidual + Tara Cross, SS-Say, Robert Lawrence + Mark Phillips, Kym Amps and Reserv&eacute;, all lovingly remastered. Thanks to everyone involved in making this happen. Limited edition of 999 numbered copies, pressed on 180 gram vinyl, and housed in heavy printed jacket accompanied by inner jacket with photos and info.Mark Lane - Electrogarden:While the genre known as Minimal Wave (the resurgence of focus on analogue synthesizer artists from the 1980's) has been spurred along by renewed interest in those instruments by a new generation of listeners and artists, the principle impetus has been provided by a handful of labels that have released, and continue to release, what where once considered lost or forgotten recordings.One such curator with a masterful ability to ferret out the most satisfying of these rarities is DJ Veronica Vasicka. As a New York City electronic music hipster gone the way of historian/archivist in an attempt to chronicle what was even then a fragmented underground, she has by some sort of Post Modern default become an impressive electronic music story herself. After just six years her aptly named label Minimal Wave has released over 30 vinyl projects preserving an illusive and secretive genre with an impeccable sense of taste.Continuing her label's narrative, the latest various artists compilation ""The Hidden Tapes"" features obscure but certainly noteworthy artists from 1979-1985. Opening up with a strong dose of arpeggiation and anthemic female vocals from Danish band SS-Say, the record moves across side ""A"" with the up tempo New Wave-ish ""Beli-Dekolte"" (meaning ""white cleavage"" in Serbian) by Oskarova Fobija who at the time were from what was then Yugoslavia. Next up is Danton's Voice with ""I Hear The Bells,"" especially interesting because it sounds like a long lost Absolute Body Control or Klinik demo. It being Belgian is no surprise. Japanese rhythmic noise artists Sympathy Nervous follow with ""Polaroid"" an unreal hypnotic groove that features a cleverly triggered or looped vocoder. And finally the pi&egrave;ce de r&eacute;sistance for side ""A"" and quite possibly the best track on the LP Pas De Deux's ""Cardiocleptomanie,"" which originally appeared on a flexi-disc included in Vinyl Magazine (pronounced vee-nil) May 1983. It is a ""less is more"" sum composed of drum machine wood blocks and bongos, a few tasty minimal synth lines, and an overlay of repetitive female vocals that touch a Krafwerkian harmonic nerve.Side ""B"" opens up with industrial sequencer vehicle ""The Computer Bank"" by Robert Lawrence and Mark Phillips. Teetering on the edges of experimental and ""Warm Leatherette"" inspired work its repetitive dissonant samples and whispered vocals provide plenty of hook. In the second track two sequencers (and their oscillators), a beat box, and some analogue strings are used as ingredients in ""Kaleidecon"" by The Fast Set. This psychedelic instrumental is a cunning exercise in manipulating overlays of rich minimal sounds. Up third is French trio Reserve with ""Destination Pour L'Inconnu,"" their minimal answer to Visage's ""Fade To Grey"" complete with accoutrement that include Ultravox-like sequencing, French language spoken female vocals, and vocoder. A rich, lush, and well produced accomplishment. The fourth song on Side ""B"" continues the New Romantic fun with Kym Amps ""You Don't Know My Name."" Lyrically walking the line between longing from afar and stalking it is a dark synthpop treasure. And closing out the disc collaborating artists Unovidual and Tara Cross serve up ""Microphone Connection."" The out of key disharmonics and strange but compelling interplay between musicians provides a fitting eclectic anything goes stamp on this compilation.Vasicka has done a stellar job delivering another essential installment in her mission to bring forward the early story of Minimal Wave. ""The Hidden Tapes"" will no doubt attract collectors and enthusiasts in droves as it forks over many very good and equally very rare if not impossible to find tracks in a beautifully designed package that goes the extra mile to emphasize the importance of this work.

But, the Kindle Touch is not a step up from my older Kindle with a keyboard, 5-way switch, and forward and backward buttons.  There are a number of design problems not worked out well with the Kindle Touch.  The major one is the inability to rotate the screen from portrait to landscape.  This deficiency makes the ability to read pdf documents worthless unless you use a magnifying glass to do it.  A second serious problem is that some common pages, the main home view for example, does not provide any place to touch the screen to turn the page.  The Kindle interprets any touch as wanting to select some item rather than going to the next page.  Although an experimental function and therefore not expected to be bug-free, the Internet brousing function is also worthless.  Displays are too small to read and, as with the home page, there is often no place to touch the screen without having it misinterpreted.  On the positive side, the slightly larger screen is nice, and as stated, the special offers really aren't a source of inconvenience at all.  I have no experience with the Kindle Keyboard, but I'd say that the little extra money for it over the Kindle Touch might be well-spent.

A2QW3PJLLN59NW,B000WVGUFG,Louie,"[11, 13]","Mirage OMD-28 Surround Speaker SystemBy Thomas J. Norton * Posted: Jun 10, 2007Omnidirectional speakers have an uneven history in the audio marketplace. They've always been few in number, but persist because a few designers believe in their unique capabilities. Whether or not you accept the validity of their theory of operation, they do offer a perspective on reproduced sound different than that provided by conventional, forward-radiating designs. Among other things, they almost invariably sound bigger and more spacious than their physical size suggests. For more on the background of omni speakers, go here.In practice there is no such thing as a true omnidirectional speaker--a point source that radiates sound equally in all directions. Real world designs are variations on that theme, and it would be more accurate to call them multidirectional speakers. But omni is the name convention has given to them, so omni it will be here.Mirage is an important player in this game. Its first ""omni,"" the M-1, appeared in the late 1980s. The M-1 was not really a classic omni design. It radiated sound to both the front and rear almost equally, but its radiation to the side was no more ""omni"" than conventional speakers. Mirage dubbed this design technique ""bipolar,"" but whatever you called it, it sounded significantly different than most contemporary designs. It more closely resembled a dipole panel speaker than an omni, though it used conventional cone/dome driver technology. And unlike a dipole, in which the front and rear radiation are out of phase, the front and back output of the M-1 were always in-phase.A long string of similar Mirage bipolar models followed. Then, more recently, Mirage went ""Omnipolar."" This design positions two conventional drivers on the sloped top of the cabinet: a midrange (or woofer-midrange) and a tweeter. The drivers are configured coaxially and fire upward into a shaped diffuser: Mirage's patented ""Omniguide."" The result is closer to true omnidirectional performance than most previous omni designs.The first Mirage Omnipolars were small satellite/subwoofer models. This technology has now expanded to encompass virtually all of Mirage's speaker line in a variety of ranges, including Omnisat, Nanosat, Omni, and OM. The review system here was comprised of the newMirage OMD-28 Rosewood 3-Way Rosewood OM Design Series Floorstanding LoudspeakerOMD-28 ($7,500/pair), OMD-C2 center channel ($2,000) andMirage OMDR Black (Ea) OMNIPOLAR(TM) Rear Surround SpeakerOMD-R surrounds ($2,000/pair), from the OM series, which is Mirage's flagship omnidirectional surround speaker system.DescriptionWhile the $7,500/pair price of the OMD-28, the speaker that anchors the left and right front channels of this system, is a long way from small change it's downright cheap these days for a flagship. But API, the manufacturer of Mirage and Energy speakers (API is now a division of Klipsch) has never played in the ""my-speaker-sells-for -more-than-your-speaker"" sandbox.API no longer builds its speakers in-house, but rather ""off-shore."" So, as it says on the shipping cartons, the designed-Here/ built-There paradigm applies to all the speakers in this system. ""Here,"" for Mirage, is API's home in Canada, while ""There,"" as usual these days, is China. While this development, as common as it now is, doesn't give me the warm fuzzies on most levels, there's no question that it offers audio enthusiasts a lot of value for money.Available in gloss black, polished rosewood, or a gorgeous polished burled maple, the OMD-28's curvaceous cabinet supports a three-way, four-driver, ported system. At the top are the midrange, tweeter, and Omniguide reflector. The 5.25"" midrange employs a multi-layer carbon/fiberglass cone with an underhung voice coil and Mirage's Ribbed Elliptical Surround technology. The word ""surround,"" as used here, does not refer to the radiation pattern but rather to the flexible surround that links the midrange cone to the driver's supporting structure or basket. The tweeter is a chambered, 28mm, titanium dome design.The OMD-28's two 8"" woofers are loaded by dual ports that radiate from the bottom of the cabinet into a slot between the main enclosure and its base. The woofers employ the same driver technology as the midrange, and together with the cabinet's ports claim a usable low frequency limit of 18Hz (-10dB).Three pairs of terminals can support tri-wiring or even tri-amping if you remove the straps that link them together. I used the links, with single wiring, for all the speakers in this review. The terminals are of very high quality but don't easily accommodate all common spades. I had to crimp the tongs of the spades on my center channel speaker leads together slightly to secure them. Bananas, however, are easily accommodated, and the terminals can be tightened down to improve the contact on bananas (which can often loosen over time, particularly with repeated use).The cabinet itself is made of braced MDF. At 73 lbs., it's relatively easy to maneuver around, though its curved sides and back make it difficult to get a good grip on its polished surface. Mirage thoughtfully provides a set of rubberized gloves, which neatly solved this problem. (Hint to speaker-moving audiophiles everywhere: you can buy similar gloves in most well-equipped home improvement stores. It's not a bad item to add to your toolbox.)Attractive, lockable spikes are also provided, but they resemble cones more than spikes and aren't pointed enough to punch through carpet and secure the speaker to the floor underneath. But they can provide a means to level the speakers, or even tilt them slightly forward or backward to fine-tune the image focus. I did not use these ""spikes"" for this review.Rigid, shaped grilles are supplied to cover the top of the cabinet and its drivers, with separate grilles for the woofers. The grilles are easy to remove and reinstall. You can pull them off for critical listening if desired and leave them in place at other times to protect the speaker. The prominent Omniguide on top, if uncovered, might be prone to damage if left uncovered in, say, a busy family room. I did most of my listening with the grilles removed.The OMD-C2 center channel has the same midrange/tweeter/Omniguide driver configuration, but in this case it's flanked by two 6.5-inch drivers that use the same proprietary technology as the other cone drivers in the system. Its acoustic suspension (unported) MDF cabinet is also available in high gloss piano black, rosewood or burled maple, and there are two sets of terminals rather than the three in the OMD-28. A rigid, perforated, dome-shaped grille is also supplied to cover the top of the cabinet and the drivers. As with the OMD-28, however, I listened to the OMD-C2 with its grille removed.With its six drivers, the small OMD-R surround just might be the most complicated speaker in the system. Mirage also calls it Omnipolar, though the lacks the Omniguide technology of the other speakers in the system. Instead, it features two 1"" Pure Titanium Hybrid (PTH) dome tweeters, two 2"", inverted pure titanium cone midranges, and two 5.25"" multi-layer carbon fiber woofers. The latter appear to be identical to the drivers used for the midrange in the OMD-28 and OMD-C2.The OMD-R's sealed MDF cabinet is available only in gloss black, and its grille is removable. Its two pair of input terminals are of a more conventional grade and design than the terminals on the other speakers in the system. They are recessed to accommodate wall mounting, and brackets are provided for this application.SetupThe OMD-28s were set up in my 3200 cubic foot home theater room, well away from the side and front walls and approximately 8 feet apart on either side of my 78 inch-wide projection screen. They were toed in toward the center listening position, though because of the omni configuration of the mid-tweeter array the degree of toe-in is less significant than with conventional speakers.The OMD-C2 center was positioned on a low stand below my projection screen, about 12-inches off the floor and tilted slightly upward toward the listening position. The OMD-R surrounds were located on stands near the back of the room.Mirage was working on new subwoofers when they sent us the OMD-28 system, so I elected to request the speakers without a sub. As it turns out, however, most of my movie listening was done with a single (Revel B15) subwoofer engaged.MusicThis section refers to a pair of OMD-28's auditioned in two-channel stereo, without a subwoofer, except as noted.If, like most of us, you're used to listening to conventional front radiating loudspeakers, your first reaction to omnis can be a bit disorienting. Not that they sound like The Speaker from Planet X, or anything like that, but they do sound different. They bring more of the listener's room into play. For better or worse, your room's reverberant characteristics become part of the mix. This is always true, of course, but it's more obvious with an omni than with a traditional speaker.All of us become accustomed to the sound of our own rooms to the point where we can almost tune it out. This is one reason why listening in an unfamiliar environment--a friend's house, a dealer showroom, a hi-fi show--can often require a period of adjustment. In a similar fashion, listening to a speaker with a radically different radiating pattern, even in your room, suddenly warps your ""room tune-out"" mechanism. You have to reboot it by learning to hear past the characteristics of your listening space all over again.Fortunately this re-learning doesn't take very long. The new acoustic signature will be nearly as familiar to you as the old one after a couple of hours of listening. Only then will you be able to fairly evaluate the OMD-28's distinctive characteristics.Mirage speakers have never been shrinking violets when it comes to bass output, and this model is no exception. Your room, system, and expectations will affect how you react to it, but at times the Mirages' bass can sound excessive, slow, and indistinct. This didn't happen often in my auditions--perhaps on 10% of the music I played. The primary offenders were complex, interwoven bass lines and, less often, close-mic'd male vocals with fundamentals that fell into just the right range to aggravate the problem. If your taste runs heavily to such material you might hear these bass aberrations more often than I did on a wider variety of recordings.I did try a subwoofer briefly on music, and it did reduce the problem by moving the bass source to a better location in the room. But it could not completely eliminate the problem since the fullness extended into the upper bass--well above the 100Hz low pass filter I used for the sub. If your room is larger than mine, however (15.5' x 26' x 8'), or has more flexible, bass dampening walls (say, single-layer sheetrock rather than the solid lath and plaster in my built-in-the-1940s abode), the occasional bass anomalies I heard from the OMD-28 might well be a non-issue for you.Despite its occasional excess, however, the solidity of the bass from a pair of OMD-28s was one of its most attractive characteristics. As noted earlier, I listened to music primarily with the speakers driven full range without a subwoofer. When I felt something was missing it was only because I knew what a good sub could do in the deepest reaches of the bass with some of my often-used reference material. I can't say that the Mirages went as deep with as much power at high levels as a first-class, separate sub, but on music they never disappointed me. In fact, even on their own they were often startling in with what they could do with instruments such as percussive drums and plucked double bass. The weight and authority of the speaker's entire bass range was compelling. Unlike many speakers, the OMD-28s never sounded the least bit lean or wimpy.Listening at nearly 90-degrees off-axis to any tweeter--as is the case with the Omnipolar designs--inevitably results in reduced treble at the listener's ears. The fact that the Mirage did not sound at all dull reflects well (awful pun!) on its Omniguide diffuser. While the speaker never sounded bright, it did tend to emphasize sibilance on some close-miked vocals. But overall, the OMD-28's top end performance was impressive. High frequency transients never sounded ""slow"" or rolled-off. Everything was there, and in the right proportion, enhanced by the spaciousness produced by the speaker's wide dispersion pattern.The Mirages also sound detailed without being ""ruthlessly revealing"" On more than one recording I heard things I hadn't heard before: a musician's fingers sliding down the strings as he plays a mandolin, his creaking chair, and a pianist grunting softly on a break between notes. But these revelations were never intrusive. In fact, recordings that sound slightly bright on other good speakers suddenly sounded right on the OMD-28s. And the recordings that sound properly balanced on other good speakers still sounded fine on the Mirage. This speaks volumes about the OMD-28's canny voicing.The midrange of the OMD-28 ranged from satisfactory to magical, depending on the recording. I heard little of the most obvious midrange colorations such as nasality and boxiness. The only time I sensed anything amiss was when the timbre of a singer's voice excited the speaker's sometimes overactive upper bass, which reduced the subjective clarity of the midrange. This happened more often on male vocals than female--no surprise there--and on close rather than distantly mic'd recordings.A pair of OMD-28's produced a huge soundstage, which sometimes even extended outside the boundaries of the left and right speakers. Audiophiles often look for this characteristic, but it appears to be very room and setup dependent and seldom happens in my home theater space.In addition, if the recording allows, the Mirages will provide an impressive sense of depth. But their lateral imaging can be more diffuse than you'll get from a good pair of front-radiating speakers. Closely mic'd voices and instruments often sounded larger and less precisely positioned than they do on speakers with superior image focus. But not always. On more than a few occasions the OMD-28s surprised me by suspending a solo vocal or instrument in the space between the speakers with an almost palpable definition and three-dimensionality.MoviesThe positioning of the front speakers demanded by the screen's fixed location in my home theater worked against the OMD-28s demonstrating their specified 18Hz in-room extension (deeper, by the way, than the specification for Mirage's largest new subwoofer, the OMD-10). This was of little importance on music, but movies were another matter. A separate subwoofer, properly positioned, could produce deeper, more powerful bass. For movies, therefore, I crossed all of the speakers over to a subwoofer (the Revel B15) below 80Hz.While I did most of my music listening using the front end of a Denon AVR-4306 receiver as a pre-pro connected to an Anthem P5 power amp, I did most of my movie watching using the amps in the Denon to drive the front channels (the rear channel amps in this sample of the Denon were inoperative for as yet undetermined reasons, so for this review an external amp was always used to drive the surrounds). This $2,000 receiver may appear to be an unlikely candidate to drive $11,500 worth of speakers (not including a subwoofer), but in practice it worked amazingly well. It did show a bit of added brightness and strain on movies when driving the OMD-28s full range without a subwoofer, probably because its recommended minimum load is 6 ohms and the OMD-28 is spec'd to dip down to 3.5 ohms. The receiver did get very warm, though just shy of being too hot to touch, when playing challenging material at high levels for more than a few minutes. But it did not shut down. And with an average assortment of programming, particularly with a subwoofer in tow, it performed well above its price level and never blinked.And the Mirage system did not blink on soundtracks either. From my usual slightly off-axis movie-watching location everything jelled. In fact, the omni speakers like the Mirage should be less affected by changes in seating position--at least on movies--than most surround speaker systems.To repeat yet again that the soundstage from the Mirage system was huge might seem redundant, but it's perhaps even more noteworthy on movies than on music. The atmosphere and sense of space that the system provides drew me into films as diverse asThe Incredibles (Four-Disc Blu-ray/DVD Combo + Digital Copy)The Incredibles, Dreamgirls, and The Guardian. And the slightly diffuse imaging of the system was much less significant with five speakers operating than with just two. I never felt that I was listening to five separate speakers. They all blended into a cohesive yet distinctive whole.The system's balance was also complementary to most movies. Their slightly forgiving yet detailed top end was as effective as cinema equalization in keeping bright soundtracks at bay. Perhaps more so, as there was no indication of a rolled-off high frequency response. And with a subwoofer to reinforce the lowest octave of deep bass for high level playback, the slightly rich, full-bodied nature of the Mirage system's mid and upper bass proved to be no liability on most soundtracks. Only rarely did I hear the over-ripe quality in this range that sometimes affected music playback, in my room, with a pair of OMD-28s alone.What I heard most often, in fact, was a slam in the bass combined with a treble balance that lets you crank things up without tearing your head off--qualities that elude many surround speaker systems on soundtracks. The action scenes in The Incredibles gave me a new appreciation for this film. They sounded right--meaty and powerful without bloat at the bottom end or fizz and excess brightness on top. The massed choruses of tap-dancing (!) and singing (!) penguins in Happy Feet rocked the room. When the helicopter flew over in the final act of that film its power and weight were palpable. And the rescue scenes in The Guardian were so compelling that I almost forgot about the film's lame script.The only obvious weakness I heard on soundtracks was in the bass balance of the OMD-C2 center channel. At times the dialog, in particular, was ripe and overly full, which not only sounded unnatural but slightly reduced intelligibility. It's very possible that this situation was aggravated by the speaker's proximity to the floor in my system (on a low stand under the screen). It didn't bother me very often, but when it did I was tempted to calibrate the Denon receiver's Audyssey equalization system, which I'm certain would have largely eliminated the problem.But I elected not to use any equalization for this review (apart from the analog parametric eq in the Revel sub). A worthwhile addition to the OMD-C2, or to any center channel in this price range, would be a multi-position contour switch to compensate for proximity to a nearby surface, whether that surface is a floor or a big screen television. Such a feature is already available on many far less expensive center channel speakers.The Mirages are also much less efficient than the average speaker. While calibrating the channel levels I had to set them about 4dB higher than usual. That would appear to indicate the need for a high power amp, and it certainly won't hurt. But the Denon receiver I used for part of the listening was adequate to the task in my medium-size room, without overheating, shutting down, or distorting, as long as the program material varied in its demands. A soundtrack with action scenes connected by quiet interludes will give the receiver a chance to unwind and cool down between challenges, in contrast to, say, a steady diet of heavy metal with a pounding synth bass track, played back at 110dB. Remember, too, that that pushing any amp into audible distortion is more dangerous to a loudspeaker than a high- power amp operating loudly but cleanly.ConclusionsWhile not without flaws (what speaker is?) the Mirages were so impressive that while listening I started to think about buying them.Unfortunately, space is an issue around these parts as review speakers do tend to pile up before we can tackle the drudgery of packing them up for return. And the Mirages' room sensitivity, combined with their deviations from technical accuracy, doesn't make them the ideal analytical tool for evaluating other products.But the tradeoffs inherent in the uniquely designed Mirage omni speakers, and in particular this OMD-28 system (the only Mirange omnis I've spend time with in my own home theater) have been so cannily balanced here that the sheer listenability of these speakers, on both music and movies, is superb. As I said earlier, adjusting to an omni design can take time, and the performance of such speakers is different enough from conventional designs that I highly recommend you precede any purchase with a thorough, personal audition.But do give them a shot. Take your time. Listen to them on a wide variety of music and movies. Become accustomed to their strengths. You might just fall in love with them.HighsHuge soundstage, with excellent depthForgiving of bright program material, but still highly detailedPowerful bass from the OMD-28s, though a good sub will further enhance their performance, particularly on movies.LowsThe bass can sound over-ripe on some material, including dialogLow sensitivityOmni sound is unique, requires some adaptation to fully appreciate, will not be to everyone's tasteThe technical measurements are not impressive",5.0,OMD Surround sound best review seen,1295481600.0,"01 20, 2011"

Vaughn,"[2, 4]","Yet another entry into the ""Jack Ryan Saves the World"" series, only this time there are Ryan surrogates: the ex-president's son and two of his cousins who happen to be twins. This book is so bad, it almost beggars belief. It is slow, preachy, abysmally written (sample sentence: ""Does not the Mafia know how to kill people?"")and a complete waste of paper. At best this was a paperback thriller, one of the kind you buy at an airport kiosk, and once you read it, you leave it on the seat. This whole improbable story could have been told in about 180 pages or in a screenplay. At least had it been a movie, you wouldn't have expected a lot.Now think about this: supersecret ""black ops"" government entity, complete with undated presidential pardons for their illegal activities and the only assassins they can find to recruit are the ex-president's cousins?! And his son, irritatingly referred to as ""youngster"" or by his full name time after time, works his way into the organization ""but don't tell Dad"" and is just a whiz at intell work? Ah, give me a break. The full name business (which W. E. Butterworth aka ""W.E.B. Griffin"" does all the time and it's irritating in his books too) makes one wonder if the author is being paid by the word. Also, the twin cousins have cute little nicknames which they and everyone else uses ad nauseum The conversations are stilted, preachy or patronizing and frequently use first names, i.e. ""Well, Bill, what do you think?"" ""Joe, I think..."" you get the picture. No one talks that way. Bad writers, however, write that way.On the plus side, Clancy is very complimentary about the police and the military, although he really has a very, very, very simplistic view of how they operate. But kudos for combat professionals, whether on city streets or in Afghanistan, don't save this not so little (400+ pages!) novel. The book will sell, based primarily on Clancy's fan base, but surely their patience with this sort of stuff is diminishing.Surely Tom Clancy doesn't need the money. It's time to push back from the old word processor and enjoy past triumphs. Spare us all more of the Ryan saga, Mr. Clancy.

We have all the movies, TV Series, some of the toys and most of the games. It&#8217;s what we do with our time together a lot of the time. She really wanted this game for Christmas so of course she got it. We have the other game like this called the 3-D Haunted House Game which we love so we were excited to play the Mystery Mine Game.The players have the choice to be any of the Mystery Inc. gang. As with the other game, movement is decided by a spinner. As you move through the mine, you encounter clues that help to reveal the culprit. You also encounter 8 different traps that will slow down your investigation so be wary! The first player to the top of the mine will be able to guess who the culprit is and will have hopefully seen the three clues needed to make the accusation. The first player to get it right wins.Granted these games are very simple and easy to play and understand which is why it saddens me to say that my experience with this game isn&#8217;t really a good one. First off all, the game fluctuated in price greatly during the holiday season. It had gone up as much as $10 dollars at Target. Secondly, the cart that rolls down the mine shaft doesn&#8217;t really work. There is a trap immediately after the release of the cart and it stop the cart every time from progressing any further. I would have to physically hold the first trap up to allow the cart to have a chance at moving down the mine shaft. The second trap veers the cart down one track or another and it often stops the cart entirely. The cart only makes it&#8217;s way down the mine about 25% of the time which in turn negates the need for the other traps.While I and my daughter finished a few games of this, it wasn&#8217;t worth the $29.99 MSRP when the game doesn&#8217;t actually provide the experience it is designed to. For a simple game, with a fun theme this one falls flat. You&#8217;d be better of just getting the Scooby-Doo Mystery 3-D Haunted House Game and leaving it at that. Putting out a game based on just a license to generate sells isn&#8217;t often a good idea and that is what happened here.

Navigation is also intuitive.FM tuner has very limited range and it depends on the earbud wire as an antenna, so I am constantly moving the wire around to improve reception even in the gym.I don't like the earbuds.  I find them uncomfortable.  The noise cancelling feature is nice, but is only partially effective.  It helps but is not a panacea.  I would say it knocks out 30-40 % of background noise (the piped in music) when I am at the gym.My main complaint is the on/off button.  You have to press and hold for a second or two to turn it off.  However, there is no such delay when turning it on, which is very sensitive and I often find it on in my pocket after I thought I turned it off.  Very irritating.Battery life is not 30+ hours.  I use only for music, not video, and I would guess I get about 15-20 hours before a full charge (which takes 24 hours).

ARX984I8G47K5,B0001AW066,friendsfan,"[7, 11]","The seventh season of ""Friends"" represents the show at it's worst. It seems as if the writers and producers were running out of steam and were losing some of the hillarious creativity that made the show Must See for the previous six seasons. The actors did what they could to try to elevate the material but, for the only time during the show's run, the cast seemed bored and detatached. Something was just amiss during this season in general. The show had a strange feel to it and to a new viewer, the once mighty ""Friends"" may have seemed like a medicore sitcom that was overhyped for no reason. Maybe  for the first time the loyal fans of the show felt that maybe it was time to bow out (thankfully season eight reinvogorated the writers, the cast, and the audience and provided a renassiance of sorts that would last until the end of the show's run). The entire season revolved around Monica and Chandler's wedding and every other storyline seems to be filler until the writer's could marry the two off in a May-Sweeps season ending episode. I believe this was the season when Perry's drug addiction was reaching its climax and, for the first and only time, his personal troubles began to affect his acting (thankfully Perry recovered and did the right thing by taking time off to get his problems in order). Chandler who once was arguably the funniest character on primetime, now became a corny shadow of himself. Monica reached an all time controlling high as she planned her wedding, and Cox again finds herself in a thankless role. To her credit, Cox does make Monica amusing and still tries to retain her likeability, but the writers prove too strong for the nearly unfailing Cox and Monica becomes a caricature (it will still be another season or two before Monica is restored to a multi-layered charming character again). Rachel's major storyline involved her relationship with her much younger assistant Tag. Rachel's work situations are always funny and Aniston again plays Rachel to a charming, if somewhat befuddled, T (as most fans know however it is not until season 8 when Aniston is really given the material and opportunity to shine). Phoebe is again not given a lot to do this season but mainly support the other characters, and again, Kudrow proves to be unfailing in her portrayal. Kudrow is maybe the only actor who is not bogged down with the material this season and she saves even some of the worst episodes (i.e ""TOW Rosita Dies""- hysterical Phoebe moments as a telemarketer trying to stop Jason Alexander from committing suicide). LeBlanc's Joey gets to reprise his role as Dr. Drake Ramoray on DOOL. LeBlanc is funny and, along with Kudrow, he is also able to provide some memorable lines and scenes in an otherwise bleak season. Schwimmer's Ross is not really given much of a story arc this season and Schwimmer is effective and funny in his role. While season seven is problematic, it is still ""Friends"" after all so there are bound to be some meorable episodes, including, ""TOW Monica's Thunder,"" ""TOW Phoebe's Cookies"" (absolutely hysterical Pheebs/Monica story and scenes), ""TOW Rachel's Assistant,"" ""TOW Chandler Doesn't Like Dogs"" (it's a Thanksgiving episode so it's bound to be a highlight), ""TOW They're Up All Night,"" ""TOW They All Turn Thirty"" (Aniston feels so funny and real here and the flashbacks to all their thirtieth birthdays are classic), ""TOW Monica and Chandler's Wedding"" (a great episode all around every actor is finally back on their game here and the episode itself feels like it belongs in one of ""Friends"" earlier and funnier seasons. This episode also provides one of the greatest shocks in ""Friends"" history and sets the stage for one of the stories that will rejuvenate the following season..Rachel's pregnancy).",3.0,"The worst season of ""Friends""",1150243200.0,"06 14, 2006"

Plus, it caused the player to have power surges.I called Griffin to get a replacement. First, they sent me back then wrong model (they sent an iPod transmitter). Two weeks later, I got the right unit, and less than 48 hours later, that one died, too.

This book failed to satisfy in all categories. Confession: after forty pages, I just couldn't force myself to read any more.""Murder Below Montparnasse"" is part of a series about private detective Aim&eacute;e L&eacute;duc, an American who lives in Paris and has a detective agency.  Perhaps I was disadvantaged by not having read the previous books in the series, although this novel does have snippets of background to let you know the circumstances and setting of the main characters.Within forty pages, about 12 characters are introduced involving 4 scenes with little or no development.  That leaves me cold.Worse, is the mix of French phrases with English prose on virtually every page.  It appears that the author is trying to use colloquial French for no reason and with little ability.  Dropping French nouns into English sentences just doesn't work.I guess that ""Murder Below Montparnasse"" is supposed to be chick lit.  For instance, Aim&eacute;e has just finished helping the police by disguising herself and selling information to a criminal in a sting operation.  As she leaves with her partner in his Citron, she ""ran her fingers through her blond-streaked shag cut hair, wishing she hadn't run out of mousse."" To me, this sounds inane.I like Evanovich, Scottoline, Lee Child, Konrath, Sandford and Baldacci, but ""Murder Below Montparnasse"" didn't engage me.

A1EU2QJHX45OV3,B0047OOEFM,"Avinash ""Jumbi""","[32, 40]","I got this game on 11/16/10 - and played it enough to evaluate the gameplay and campaign mode. **EDIT** Also played online solo mode (with 3 other onle players).In short - it is a clone of the original arcade hit, with some notable additions.The campaign mode is basically a 2 on 2 basketball game, with actual NBA players (the best players on each team are available - no bench players).  This is Arcade basketball at its best - no fouls, no timeouts, no out of bounds and NO REFS.  There is a 24 second shot clock, and you can get called for goal-tending once in a while.The controls are simple:ON OFFENSE, you can perform some rediculous dunks, and if you are skilled enough, you can get some jumpshots in.  You can pass, upfake, throw elbows, do crossovers and jump for an alley-oop (the last 2 are additions to the original).  You only contol 1 player, but you can call for a pass as well as make your team-mate shoot/dunk.  You can also throw elbows and knock a defender to the floor if he is too close.ON DEFENSE:  You can steal the ball (this requires some timing), shove any opposing player to the floor (if you miss the shove, your opponent can blow right by you) and rebound.  You can also intercept a pass if you are in the right position.  BUT THE BEST PART ABOUT DEFENSE is BLOCKING SHOTS.  You have to be in the right position and time it right - but the absolute joy of stuffing the opponent's shot is unlike any other feeling in a game (in my opinion).  You can even block a dunk - if you are get there at the top of the opponent's jump.On both offense and defense, you can shove an opponent to the floor (on offense only if you are not the ballhandler).EA also kept the play by play announcer from the original - Tim Kitzrow.  All of the original humorous calls are here - with tons of new ""Jamonics"" added.  You will find yourself cracking up in the middle of gameplay when you hear some of these.You can unlock past players with specific achievements - this is another great feature of this game - Magic, Larry (Bird and Johnson), Schrempf, Dominique, Rodman, McHale and much more.  You can also play as Politicians, the Beastie Boys and other non NBA teams.The original arcade game did not look as good as this (it was not in HD).  The vibrant colors and the clarity of the players faces in this HD version really stand out.  The Big Head Mode is unlocked by finishing the tutorial.You can team up locally against the cpu (or vs a friend), ** Edit or 2 vs 2 locally ** or you can play solo online, or as a team.There are other modes as well as robust online features (available as a day one patch).**Edit** I've played a few games online (2 vs 2)- there is no lag in the gameplay - just pure excitement.**The games are only 3 minutes per quarter - which I thought was too short before I started playing.  But with the clock stopping after every shot (and at goal-tending and shot clock violation) the actual time for a complete is closer to 15 minutes, which turned out to be perfect.  I never got the feeling that the game was too short once a game is completed.I haven't been a fan of EA Sports lately - BUT they got this one right.  Originally slated as a stripped doen free downloadable - they added all of the content as the Wii version, plus the vast online features and sell it for the same price.If you were skeptical about buying this game - Don't be.If you ever dropped quarters in the original Arcade game - I highly recommend this.If you have'nt played the Arcade version, and only played previous console versions, you won't get a true sense of this version.  This is WAY better than any older home version!!!If you have't played any version and wan't a purely fun game for you and friends - then get this.

The Surfers are great, but in a different way. Alice Donut's work is better informed by a sense of humor and a lively attitude than the Surfers, who usually come off as being much darker and more serious. However, this does not mean that Alice Donut does not pack some weight - in keeping with many Alternative Tentacles bands, Alice Donut follows in the footsteps of the Dead Kennedies with thier lyrics - heavy sarcasm, but always socially and politically relevant.""Mule"" was their third LP, and after this album they kicked bass player and second vocalist Ted Houghton out of the band.

But that means... not for do-it-yourself cuts, except a crewcut.Details: I tried this cutter and now use a vacuum-based (e.g. Flowbee or Robo-cut) unit instead.  This cutter requires that the hair either stand by itself or be held up vertically, typically with a comb.  (It is intended to be used ""against the grain"", or across the grain if hair is held).  Thus, except for crewcuts, you must use two hands, making it difficult to clip your own back and sides without a lot of practice.  Other reviewers complained about cutting speed/sharpness.  I had no trouble, but I charged a brand-new clipper overnight, and left the power supply plugged in, *AND* oiled the blades with some clipper oil from another product I was testing.  I tried it later without re-oiling, and it actually ran slower!  The ""perma lube"" seems like marketing nonsense: one can titanium- or teflon-coat, but it will still run easier with a little oil.  (This model is not supplied with an oil vial; use only trimmer oil.)  Also, it's true that 3.0V NiCd power (The body is sized for 2xAA, though I didn't take mine apart.) might not be enough to drive the trimmer long-term.  Especially without oiling, the head heats up, and actually slows down -- you can hear it for yourself -- during long use.  Stop, let the head cool, and start again.I would have given it 3 stars, because it's only ""mostly OK.""  But it got 4 because it's sooo inexpensive!

ANHSLSE31NMC,B0010ML5ME,"Cat Mom ""Jean""","[22, 23]","This toy has great concept and our Cats just love it! It took them a few times to get the idea of the toy and not afraid of the motor sound. Now they request it with a meow or rub against any chance they can get to have us turn it on. If they hear us touch it they will come from their curled up spot in an instant.I highly recommend this toy if you purchase this toy from a retailer that does returns easily. I bought mine local because I did not not know if my cats would play with it and approximately $30.00's for a cat toy is quit a bit of money and wanted to be able to return it if they did not have any interest.The first one I brought home worked on high speed for 1 hour and the batteries were completely drained. I think I burned the motor out some even though the directions to not say not to do it on carpet. I did on very low pile carpet and it wears the motor out. Very little instructions to the toy. Make sure you swing out the legs on the bottom of the toy which balances it, which did not explain well in the packaging instructions. I returned it to the local store that I purchased it from and exchanged it for another one. The second one I received I decided to be smart since we don't have much floor area and our cats like to play in the living or family room which is carpet. I put it on a piece of plexi-glass on top of the carpet area and placed the toy on it. After my cats got the hang of it they really like the feather attachment. In 3 days I went through a package of 16 Duracell copper-top batteries. The toy takes 3 batteries and it goes through batteries in 1 hour of operation on high speed. You can go longer on slower speed but the cats seem to find it more challenging to get it before it hides again on the high speed.To solve that problem you need to buy 2 sets of 3 rechargeable batteries with a charger that can charge more than 2 batteries at a time. We would put 3 batteries in and when they wear out we put them in the charger and the new charged battery in the toy.For the price this toy is not that durable and expensive on regular alkaline batteries. The motor needs more improvement. the pieces are all plastic. The most durable part is the cover which is made with durable vinyl. The different wands just snap on and eventually your cat can pull it off and just made of plastic. The bad thing now is our cats love it and request of us to turn it on. I would like to see improvement on quality and more safety to this toy and less chance of a cat chewing the plastic parts if you cannot supervise your cat at play. Definitely the way this toy is made you need to supervise it and as soon as the cats look like they are loosing interest to turn it off.If this toy wears out I don't think I would buy it again until I see improvement and better quality in this toy.Our two cats can't get enough of it they are addicted to this toy. The concept of this toy thinks like a cat and brings their hunting challenge out in them.Great toy but needs to be built better for the price. They should offer rechargeable batteries with charger and improve the motor so it does not drain batteries on high speed.It is definitely a fun toy for them if your cat is bored with normal toys this toy is worth purchasing for the fun aspect for your cats they will love it! If I purchased it again I would buy automatically replacement wands. I have had mine 3 weeks and my cats have the feathers pulled off of the feather attachment. They did not seem to attracted to the mouse tail attachment, I guess because it does not stick out as far under the cover less intriguing to my cats.Worth purchasing to give your cats some new excitement. Buy where you can return it for a 2nd one if needed. Make sure it is on a smooth surface and not carpet. Invest in a rechargeable batteries and 3-4 battery charger is a must if you purchase this toy.Your cats will love it and I have one 6 and 10 year old cats!",3.0,Cats love it!

A3AXLXW850J7HR,0061962147,,"[0, 0]","Being a good friend of Alison Arngrim's for several years, maybe I'm a little biased when I rave about how much I love her book, but just take a look at all the amazing reviews from other readers about it, and know what a chord it seems to have struck with everyone!I first read this book in Alison's home when I was visiting her on holiday in April of this year (she signed the first ever copy to myself and my partner!), and what a surreal experience it was, reading the words she wrote in her own home, hearing her voice in real life (talking to her husband, or to someone on the phone!) in the background, while I was hearing her voice in my head while turning the pages!For me, I couldn't put the book down and have re-read it three times since then, and can't express how much I love it.She is a natural comedienne, of course, and at times the book is laugh out loud hilarious (I defy anyone not to break into laughter at least twenty times like I did! My sides ached when she recounted how her sweet, gentle Auntie Marion dealt with a burgular trying to break into her home!!!!), and while Alison has generally lived a charmed life, she also has had some terrible things happen, like all of us - and she writes this without any kind of ""Ooh, boo hoo - poor me!"". She tells the facts as they happened, and how she managed to overcome them later in life, and how she went on to help so many others who went through similar situations she knew all too well.Fans of Little House On The Prairie will be thrilled with the anecdotes and stories Alison has provided from her days on the set, and Alison's style of writing is just superb. I was enthralled to read how a shy tomboy who wouldn't say boo to a goose, had to swap her jeans and sneakers for petticoats and fancy dresses to become Nellie Oleson, the most unforgettable television bitch of all time!Tales of what went on behind the scenes, memories of classic episodes and especially her fellow Prairie cast members are enthralling - many fans will be shocked to realise that in spite of portraying enemies onscreen, Alison and Melissa Gilbert (Laura Ingalls) were, in reality, joined-at-the-hip best friends from the moment they met, while Melissa Sue Anderson (Mary Ingalls) was infact cold, aloof and the most ""Nellie""-esque person on the show!Alison also pays great respect to the two men on Little House, who left us too early, both of whom will forever be important and beloved to her for all time - the legendary Michael Landon, and her TV husband and dear friend Steve Tracy, who sadly died of AIDS at 32 in 1986, which led to Alison doing all she could to raise awareness for the disease, not an easy task in the mid '80s.There is not a false note in the entire book, and you will be drawn into Alison's world and feel as if you're there watching the whole thing happening as you read every chapter. Alison's accounts about her less than conventional childhood in a show biz family are also outstanding.I'm praying Alison writes a sequel, because God knows this book could have been as huge as a Yellow Pages with many more chapters.  By and far one of the best memoirs you are ever likely to read - again, again and again! If only other actors writing their memoirs possessed the same kind of extraordinary humour and intelligence as Alison Arngrim does.

Mailund, the big white house, has been in the family for years and although not in perfect shape, gives them a break from their everyday existence. This time around, Jon has come to finish his novel. A task that seems impossible due to many things, but mainly the writer&#8217;s block that he regularly complains of. But there is a lot more going on. Jon&#8217;s affair with a woman down the street is what takes him out of the house on a regular basis, and even though he often tells his wife that he&#8217;s &#8220;walking the dog&#8221;, Siri is aware of his philandering ways and yet, doesn&#8217;t say anything to him, hoping that he&#8217;ll come to his senses.That alone is enough material for a novel but The Cold Song does not stop there. Milla, a young girl hired to care for the children, becomes Jon&#8217;s obsession. Although their interactions are innocent enough, the tension is palpable whenever these two are in the room with one another. Milla, is also the focus of Alma, Jon and Siri&#8217;s twelve-year-old daughter. Alma seems to note the connection between Milla and her father right away, but Alma is not all there and has issues of her own to contend with. When Milla goes missing, the town is turned upside down trying to solve the mystery and Milla&#8217;s mother, Amanda, is convinced that Jon and Siri have something to do with her disappearance.This is not a flashy, in your face, detective story or a story about a broken marriage. It&#8217;s a beautifully constructed story centered around flawed (VERY) flawed characters trying to find their place as the situations around them escalate out of control. These are not the types of friends that I&#8217;d like to have, ever, but man, did they make for some good reading. I wouldn&#8217;t say that anyone in this house is normal, except maybe the dog but their interactions with each other are awkward and sometimes disturbing and somehow it all works.What I liked most about this novel is that it&#8217;s not any one thing. It&#8217;s not a mystery, or a romance or any of the genres that you typically think of when classifying a novel.Have you read it? Have you read any books by Other Press before?

A1CDNTB7377YH2,B006X4GLNW,Michael A. Newman,"[1, 3]","I was approached by the author to review this book and I am grateful that he chose me for the honor.  I had previously enjoyed his historical fiction work entitled, ""The Fixer.""  That book was excellent in every way.  This book is more of a short story that I read in about an hour.  The narrator of the book starts with the premise that all people are ""stamped"" with a certain year of their life.  This means that something about that year defines the person you are and how you choose to lead the rest of your life.  He gives examples of some of his relatives, before going into the story of Tommy Courten, one of his friends.Courten served in Vietnam and during a mission in 1968, his actions led to the death of 200 Vietcong as well as the man who was right next to him.  The personality gleaned for Tommy was a person who took charge and fought against the norm if he didn't believe it.  Tommy's sister is the victim of a brutal crime and when the authorities cannot capture the perpetrator, it is up to Tommy to hunt him down.The story is a very quick read and I tried to rate it higher but was not sure what the author was trying to precisely convey as Tommy later comes to the realization about the person he has become.  Perhaps if the author had expanded this part of the book it would have been better.  Also, having been to both Cartegna and Barranquilla Colombia several times, I was a little taken aback by the author's descriptions of the locations.

His vet diagnosed him with a protein allergy and said he would always have to be on a hypo-allergenic diet which is only available through vets with prescription. The food fixed Rico's digestion problems, so I thought nothing else of it. A few years later, he started having seizures. Awful, atypical seizures that would last for hours. We sought treatment from a neurologist who prescribed different medications. Some of which didn't work. Others made him loopy and unacceptably not himself. Thanks to a wonderful woman who read my post on a pet md message board, I did research on the food Rico was eating. Not good!! The food had an ingredient known to cause seizures, BHA, though none of the numerous vets we saw even mentioned food as being a culprit. I immediately researched hypo-allergenic, natural foods. Against medical advice, I took him off the medication and started him on Orijen 6 Fish that day! He has not had a seizure since then. Not one.

A1VW1DJK6CFLDW,B001BERFLQ,Claire Burke,"[26, 28]","I'd been using Nature's Plus Source of Life Red liquid multi for months and I loved the taste. Then I read an article about how Sodium Benzoate, when mixed with ascorbic acid, creates a lovely carcinogen called benzene.  Aside from causing cancer, there are UK studies linking benzoates to immediate DNA damage, which theoretically may be causing Parkinsons & other neurological disorders.Knowing I had seen the ingredient before, I looked at my beloved liquid vitamins (I also was taking almost all of the Wellesse liquid supplements--now down the drain) and what do they contain? Either Sodium Benzoate or Potassium Benzoate (same carcinogenic result as Sodium Benzoate when mixed with ascorbic acid). Of course, the multi-vitamins also contain large amounts of ascorbic acid. Even the liquid Animal Parade children's vitamin that I had given my kid for years has it in it!So I did more research on this, and it seems solid despite the fact that these ingredients are highly prevalent today. The only rebuttals I could find are that the carcinogenic amounts created are small in quantity and therefore, your body should be able to handle them. I don't find this comforting. There doesn't seem to be any rebuttals to the DNA damage findings. Furthermore, since its in nearly everything, saying that the amounts are small in one product is not taking into account all the other things we may consume per day that also contain it. There are also several published studies on the detrimental effects of Benzoates on kids (its used as a preservative in lots of things) even when its not used in conjunction with ascorbic acid.So the hunt was on a for a liquid multi without benzoates, and I found Bluebonnet's Liquid Super Earth and liked it.  However, my research led me even further (I won't go into...here) and I've since switched to whole food products made by The Synergy Company and am very happy (I was never able to tolerate any of New Chapter's whole food supplements, which is why I switched to liquids in the first place).Sorry for the long post. If anyone has any info contrary to what I've found on Benzoates, or has found other quality liquid supplements without benzoates, please comment.

A2XMESTISZ0W85,B004LQ1QDE,"Martin Phillips ""Tigger""","[6, 6]","I bought this display to use with my Nikon D300s, hooking it up to the HDMI output on the camera. The intention is to view still photos on the larger 5"" screen immediately after capture instead of the 3"" static display on the back of the camera. Why? because it is easier and quicker to assess the quality of a still photograph on a larger screen than it is on a smaller screen. I wanted 7"" but decided to try the 5"" Sony.For hand held still photography, the display can be rotated to lie parallel to the lens. It does not have to stand vertically as in the photos of the gear. However, with it vertical or flat and parallel to the lens, it did not get in the way of shooting. I soon got used to it. One drawback, to fill the 5"" screen when mounted on Nikon D300s, I have to press the the D300s enlarge button once. You can use the D300s enlarge button to full extent if you wish (13x) but to fill the screen you need to push it once.Anything you can display on the D300s rear screen is displayed on the Sony 5"" screen but not as the same time. It is one or the other. The 5"" screen improves using live view on the D300s.Was I able to assess photos more easily and quicker than on the 3"" screen? Definitely!I also used the 5"" screen with the D300s on a tripod. I am pleased with how it works in both the landscape and portrait mode on a tripod.

I connected this to a combination wireless (USB) Logitech keyboard and mouse.  I never once experienced any issues with this KVM.  The first switch always occurred in a second or two.  And as long as I didn't try to immediately switch back to the other computer, then there was minimal delay.  However, if I switched from PC1 to PC2, and then immediately back to PC1 from PC2, there was probably a 5 -8 second delay.  As longs as a few minutes passed between switches, then the first switch would always take less than two seconds to complete.",5.0,Worked great!,1364947200.0,"04 3, 2013"

A3PIDHGAL2JGN1,B002JFWFXY,Benjamin W. Hartley,"[4, 4]","The _AT&T;_ answering machine arrived in fine shape two whole days before the promised delivery date. The packaging was up to Amazon's usual high standard: a large carton with lots of plastic ""balloon"" packing. I don't see how anything could get damaged, short of being run over by a truck.Installation was simple: I merely replaced a previously-installed machine which gave up the ghost after a recent thunderstorm and close-by lightning strike. It took me about three minutes to have the new machine up and running. Even had I not the prior experience, the documentation is written in clear, understandable English, not ""Japlish"" as is too ofter the case. (I do wish that documentation could be supplied in a format other than one single folded and unwieldy sheet. That's a minor quibble.)Setting the machine's clock, and other settings, e.g., the number of rings before it picks up, occupied all of ten minutes. It took that long for me to fiddle around and modify several settings. I opted for the supplied default in most cases, as I really don't require a customized installation.Having received several incoming calls, I can now say that the _AT&T;_ model 1739 works quite well, indeed. It appears to satisfy all my requirements for a very reasonable price.(Oh, yes: I did inform Amazon that their catalog picture and description don't match. They say they'll get back to me, but truthfully, I'm not holding my breath.)UPDATE: Amazon has indeed changed the description on their catalog page, so that the text and the picture agree. The change was made on September 20, 2013, and I have been unforgivably remiss for not acknowledging it.

I wanted to make sure the Icom one was at least decent. Seems to me that Sony and all the other big brands use all the same hardware. OK maybe Sony puts in a fancier processor but it's not worth 3x the price. We plugged this in, hooked it up via HDMI to our TV and Voila. It played regular DVDs and blu-ray without a problem. Sound connected correctly to TV too. The USB port works and sent the USB content to the TV but while video would play, no sound was present. Not a deal breaker but a minor disappointment (we can insert the USB right into the TV and it plays fine). The player was narrower than I thought it would be (see customer pictures). And the software that runs the machine is quite good. The DVD boots up really fast and it even resumes where you left off if you had it on pause too long and the player turns off. In all, we are quite pleased.Update 27 December 2013:We bought this for $125 2 weeks ago. Yesterday the price was $113. I contacted Amazon and thankfully, they refunded the difference. Today I saw the price was $107. Maybe by January 2 it will be free? LOL. This kind of player at this price is an excellent deal. Do it.",5.0,so far so good,1388016000.0,"12 26, 2013"

I have used an SG2 for two years and I was very pleased with its performance on the golf course.  You can read other reviews that I am sure will testify that it is a wonderful tool to have on the course.  I went out today to play for only the second time this year.  When I turned the SkyCaddie on, it gave me a message that said my ""membership"" expired two weeks ago, what would I like to do?  I would like to finish my round of golf.  It brought up the course as it always did and worked fine for three holes.  On the fourth hole it gave me the same message but when I tried to just continue my round of golf I discovered that my ""membership"" service had just erased all the data on my SkyCaddie!!  I paid for the hardware.  I paid for the ten courses it allowed me to have in the unit (I was only using four.)  The satellites belong to the Government and we can use them for free.  But, because I didn't instantly renew my ""membership"" they erased my course data!!  In my mind, this would be like MicroSoft erasing my Windows XP because I didn't upgrade to Vista.  I find this to not only be aggravating but also unethical.  I play 90% of my rounds on the same course.  However, because I do travel a bit, I purchased their $50 membership that covers the United States.  Now I find that if all I ever want to do is to play my home course, I will have to pay them $30 every year to do that, even though it is my hardware and I have paid for the course data.

AJ1ZEMJSJYDOC,0345471016,Carol S.,"[2, 2]","One night in 1986, someone shot rancher Hugh-Jay Linder in his house, and his wife Laurie disappeared.  Twenty-odd years later, their daughter, who was three at the time of the murder(s) and with her grandparents on the fateful night, has come back to her hometown to teach English at the local high school.  But soon Jody Linder hears horrifying news:  Billy Crosby, the man convicted of her father's murder, has been released from prison and is nowliving three blocks away from her, and bent on taking revenge on the Linder family, claiming he was convicted of a crime he didn't commit.Jody starts to ask questions about her late father and missing mother, and even encounters Billy Crosby's son Collin, now a lawyer working to clear his father's name.  Jody starts to wonder if maybe Billy Crosby is innocent.  And if he's innocent, then that means a murderer is still out there...I found the story of Jody's quest to find her father's murderer and figure out the fate of her mother to be a quick and entertaining read.  Pickard writes with great affection and elegance of a rancher's life on the Kansas plains, and she creates a very real sense of place; Kansas is as much as a character in the book as any of the individual people who live there.  Her characters are vivid and likeable, and the plot moves briskly.  Overall, an enjoyable and fast-paced read.",4.0,Enjoyable mystery set in Kansas ranch country,1274227200.0,"05 19, 2010"

A3MV4J00PJXNND,0966919327,Kelly Sessions,"[0, 0]","House of Miracles proclaims itself to be ""a collection of interrelated stories about love."" And it is. But it's also much more than that. This is a collection of vignettes that, when combined, give piercing insight into the lives of multiple characters. And it is softly, quietly, mightily beautiful.This book reminded me of one of my favorite movies, Love Actually, with its eclectic, interrelated ensemble cast. In this case, though, time changes as well as point of view, and the narrators aren't revealed at the start of the stories, so the reader is kept guessing. I enjoy being kept on my literary toes, so to speak, and had great fun trying to guess whose story I was in as well as ""when"" I was and how this character would tie in with the others.Ulrica Hume's writing has a soaring, airy, yet realistic quality that I truly enjoyed. I found myself underlining sentences, not because of their profundity, but because of the beautifully simplistic way she has of making the everyday seem poetic. For instance, of Leong, an immigrant from Thailand whose husband's life had come to a violent early end, ""Her heart was a rain-filled flower.""Or this gem, as Janet ponders her future while assisting the elderly Mrs. von Meurs: ""I feared that one day I'd find myself in the same situation: old and alone in a crumbling gingerbread house of sweetly decaying, once beautiful dreams.""Don't let all my talk of beauty fool you, though: there is sadness in these stories, too. Heartbreak, loneliness, and uncertainty abound. But through it all, there is love. And isn't that what life is all about?All in all: High-quality writing and interesting, touching subject matter. Much more moving than I expected. (I'm still not entirely sure why, but the parts about the hope chest made me well up.

The new pump is absolutely silent - Have to touch it to know it is running, so if you hear yours it is defective. Took about an hour to get it in.. mostly with finding some heat-shrink tubing and my heat gun.. have to take apart the all the filters to get to the screws. --- if you get a replacement pump ask for heat-shrink as well, I had some laying around, but most people don't....2. New blue clips are all in seems I was missing a couple of others as well I hadn't seen and he sent extras so all is well3. Taste is still pending - New alkalizer cartridge is in for now and after I flush it a few times I ought to know if I just had a defective one or not.Verdict - Gonna keep it and marking it up to 5 stars... it isn't perfect, but very pleased with the company and the filter even if I end up dropping the alkalizer again.RobertUpdate 7/7/2014 - Received a call back, figured it would be after the holiday weekend.Very helpful:The alkaline filter was my taste issue... He is sending a new one to try out, and some tubing to leave it bypassed if it doesn't make it better.Let him listen to the booster pump and it is defective/going bad and he is sending along a new one of those.Sending out spare blue clipsBought ""iSpring 100GPD 7-Stage Reverse Osmosis RO UV Alkaline Water Filter System with Booster Pump"" from Amazon and installed it 6/28/2014My skill level: Very handy - I do my own plumbing and sweat copper pipes or replace valves as needed.Installation:  2 hours - mostly spent figuring out how it was supposed to go, fixing leaks, and figuring out how to mount the tap on the sink.Good: Simple install with easy connectionsBadMissing two of the blue clips (have contacted them, but haven't heard back yet) - used an E-clip from the toolbox until they send me the proper bit.  Waiting on them to call me back so they can ship me the two clips.All the tubes had to be trimmed 1/4"", they seem to have been cut with a heated blade at the factory and are just enough out of round to cause leaks.. trim them and they work fine.Instructions - Online Video is a must see and good - printed instructions need some serious work - The pictures don't match the filter, tube colors not printed on the pictures, etc... just needs a complete re-do by someone installing each type unit verse trying to be genericRO tap for the top of the sink - I used the sprayer hose hole verse drilling something new - the tap is WAY to small for this and with my sink being cast iron they hole is a bit over 1/4"" thick... so the mounting hardware completely useless.  Ended up cutting a piece of metal out in the garage and drilling a hole in it to feed the thing through and span the gap.  A strap for this or a plastic spacer included in the kit would have been nice and saved me 20 minutes of fiddling in the garage to make something work.Usage - I've drained and refilled it about 10 times since install - it has a funky taste to it I was assuming from the tank, but to test I've removed the alkaline filter to verify that it isn't the cause.  This is the second topic I am waiting on a call-back from Ispring on.How it works - The numbers - I also bought the dual TDS (total dissolved solids) in-line meter so I could have numbers to watch and see when to change the filters verse just guessing.TDS at the inlet is approx 300PPM... I confirmed this with an aquarium water test kit... my GH and KH are both pretty high....Outlet TDS in the tube feeding the tap:with alkaline filter in - first cup or two of water - 180 TDS - after that it drops quickly to 27~30 TDS.With the alkaline filter out - around 15~18 TDSMy conclusion is that the alkaline filter DOES something, but unless you are only taking a cup at a time and letting it build up again it doesn't add a lot.The Booster pump - Wow, for what it is and does it is LOUD - not as loud as an old school dishwasher, but an annoying clank/clatter to be sure.  It is mounted on a cradle that has rubber washers to the bracket so they tried something, but the clatter comes from the pump itself.  Going to ask them about this when I talk to them as well.Conclusion - It seems to do the job of filtering, but unless we can get to the bottom of the taste issue I'll return it.  If I do keep it I'll probably wrap the pump in some dynamat to kill the noise.If they call me back and we solve the missing parts and taste issue I'll probably raise the rating from 3 stars to 5.  If they don't call me back and make it right I'll return it.Robert",5.0,"Had some issue, excellent phone based customer service and seems like it is all fixed.",1404345600.0,"07 3, 2014"

The locals are fierce and want to protect their small town, but some of them are on the wrong side of the law. Who do you trust and what happens when someone betrays your trust? This is just the beginning of Not This Time.Since I had not read the previous Crossroads books (Forget Me Not: A Novel (Crossroads Crisis Center)andDeadly Ties: A Novel (Crossroads Crisis Center)), I had a lot of catching up to do. The first 100 pages was fast paced as I tried to keep up with all the characters and the drama as it unfolded. It was not enjoyable to me as I struggled to understand the storyline while trying to understand the many characters and how they were related to the other characters especially when some of the characters had code names as part of the terrorist group. It was just too much for me. I think I would have enjoyed this book had I read the 2 previous books, but there was nothing on this cover of this book to tell me that this was part of a series. I thought it was a stand alone book. It could be, as the author did catch the reader up with the characters and their back stories. However, it took so much time and energy to catch-up, that I was worn out by the end of the book.So the book was decent enough but not an easy read if you have not read the other books in the series.

A2O57LB3BP3WTS,B007T8HB3U,"Scamp4553 ""Keith Lussier""","[0, 0]","Yes, the title of this review and the album are both accurately representative of what this band has succeeded after 2010's very lackluster effort, ""Feeding the Wolves"". 10 Years is not going through the motions anymore, which was holding back ""Feeding the Wolves"" and making it one of my least favorite albums of all time, other than the predictability of that record's songs, save for the small majority I liked on that record (Shoot It Out, Dead In The Water, Now Is The Time). I feel like ""Minus the Machine"" is 10 Years' proper third album because the band experimented more than they did on their last record.All of the 12 tracks featured on the album mirror the songs featured on ""The Autumn Effect"", and can easily be distinguished from one-another, despite them using the Drop C# tuning that they used on all of their previous efforts. The album opens with, ""Minus the Machine"", which is here to state the band's motive of escaping the middle man and doing whatever they please with their sound, which is clearly the right thing to do. ""Battle Lust"" is a fantastic song that has a very crushing guitar riff, and melodic vocals to further elevate the song's intensity. Even though the drumming is a little bit off, the first single, ""Backlash"" is also a highlight. Songs like, ""Sleeper"", ""Tightrope"", ""Soma"", and the haunting closer, ""And All The Other Colors"", also expand the band's prowess.There is only one little complaint that I have about the album. While Jesse Hasek is good at singing, the screamed vocals on the otherwise solid cut, ""Knives"", aren't that good. But that problem is so little, that it's very hard to nitpick at it for long. This whole album is a complete return to form. The band has stepped up tremendously from their previous album, while it still does have its flaws. This is a great tribute to the band's old sound, and they surely did it well, unlike a few interchangeable bands which I'm sure at this point you know already. While it's far away from one of the best albums of 2012, 10 Year's fourth studio effort, ""Minus the Machine"" is very fit for an honorable mention.TRACKS:Minus The Machine (5/5)Battle Lust (5/5)Forever Fields  (4/5)Backlash (4/5)Writing On The Walls (4/5)Dancing With The Dead (4/5)Sleeper (5/5)Soma (4/5)Tightrope (5/5)Knives (3/5)Birth/Death (4/5)And All The Other Colors (5/5)ALBUM SCORE: (52/60)Rating: 4 stars/5 stars",4.0,Destroying The Machine,1350691200.0,"10 20, 2012"

She analyzes a wide range of material covering political, social, personal and mythical genres: Art Spiegelman's Holocaust memoir ""Maus""; Alison Bechdel's lesbian-feminist reflections in ""Fun Home""; the King Arthur tales in ""Prince Valiant""; as well as the more commonly-known comics of Batman, Superman and Donald Duck.I enjoyed reading this book even though I agree with other reviewers that the paperback and Kindle prices are outrageously high and will limit the market appeal to the textbook audience. In fact, Dr. Kukkonen's Introduction states, ""(this book) is designed to provide you with all the knowledge you need for studying and analyzing comics on a university course.""The ridiculous pricing is a reflection of that narrow demographic (remember buying college textbooks that cost almost as much as the course itself?

As another reviewer indicated:Then we noticed the vocal problems. The vocals don't register accurately and it is impossible to go into overdrive vocally.Then it gave us the high pitched screeeeeach over the speakers.Then it crashed after a song.It is very frustrating to play and we usually just give up and go back to RB2...It is incredibly disappointing that they released this game and never fixed the obvious bugs in it.  They had to know that these bugs existed and it's extremely frustrating to know that they 'deferred' these bugs considering their severity.  These should've been showstoppers and should have been addressed before shipping.  We didn't get through 1/20th of the game before we ran into issues over and over again.

Thus we have volumes about science fiction and feminism (for examplethisorthis), science fiction and race (e.g.thisorthis), science fiction and religion (this,this) and so on.But whereas the books on those topics seem to end up looking at a fairly narrow slice of SF (a slender intersection of two circles in a Venn diagram, so to speak), Science Fiction and Empire encompasses quite a broad swath of SF. Indeed, I came away from this book feeling that it's one of the more interesting and important works of SF studies I've read.There are several reasons why the intersection of SF studies and imperialism studies is so unexpectedly wide. As a starting point, there is the huge number of ""galactic empire"" stories in SF, especially in earlier space opera. What does it say about the culture of SF that such stories were and remain so popular? What sorts of empires, evil and benevolent, were imagined by SF writers?But there's much more to the intersection of imperialism and SF than the immediately obvious. In the study of imperialism, the notion of ""the Self"" vis a vis ""the Other"" is a central concept. How do we interact with groups and cultures different from ourselves? How does power influence this interaction? These and related questions have been studied byEdward Saidand other ""postcolonial"" scholars. The parallels to SF are obvious; ""the Other"" in SF may be aliens, artificial intelligences, future humanity, etc., but many of the issues involved would be familiar to Said and his colleagues.Further, there are the parallels between exploration (surely one of the central themes of SF) and expansionism (a word almost synonymous with imperialism). Consider the SF idea of teraforming, the ethics of which are explored in Kim Stanley Robinson'sMars trilogy. The notion that any place we can go to thereby becomes our property, to do with as we like, is not far removed from an imperialistic mindset.And then there's the common SF theme of power struggles between colonists and their home world (e.g. the Mars trilogy again, Heinlein'sThe Moon Is a Harsh Mistress). Or that ofinvasionby a technologically superior race upon one less advanced. Again these are issues and fields of thought that have been explored in imperialism studies.This is just a sampling of some of the ideas covered in this book. There is much more, including a chapter on Iain M. Banks' ""meta-empire"", ""postcolonial"" Culture novels that I found particularly interesting.The target audience for books of the sort I mention in the first paragraph might be characterized as ""those who are interested in SF and also interested in [fill in the blank -- feminism, religion, etc.]."" Science Fiction and Empire, on the other hand, I would call simply a book for those who are interested in SF. As author Patricia Kerslake puts it, ""The theme of empire, [...] is so ingrained in SF that to discuss empire in SF is also to investigate the fundamental purposes and attributes of the genre itself."" I completely agree. Kerslake convincingly shows that the overlap between imperialism studies and SF studies is so great that any serious study of SF is simply incomplete without a book like hers.",5.0,Surprisingly broad and important study of  the intersection of SF and imperialism,1346630400.0,"09 3, 2012"

While seminary did offer some study in this area, I have searched long for such a practical guide to understanding the minister's role within the church.  The Reverend Dr. Metze offers a helpful graphic before the first chapter which allows the reader an overview of his thesis.  Metze centers his leadership model on God, God's word and wisdom, and God's call.  Then Metze shows how our discipleship and discernment, steeped in humility, must be a balance between four different types of leadership:  symbolic, political, structural, and human resource-centered.  In explaining his thesis, the Rev. Dr. Metze is thorough and very Biblically centered; at the same time, however, he explains each concept using stories from his personal experiences as a pastor.  I would recommend this book to a first year ministery student as well as to a seasoned professional who wants to clarify his or her direction in ministry and leadership; this book would also be helpful to lay leaders in the church.",5.0,Much-Needed Ministry Model is Here!,1165363200.0,"12 6, 2006"

A17IW44FV0HUTY,0451047117,Glen Engel Cox,"[4, 4]","I was attacted to this book (and series by Benson) because Tom Holt has written sequels to these books, and I felt like I should read the originals before searching out Holt's pastiches. I was reminded of these in a recent thread on rec.arts.books regarding writers similar to Wodehouse. Finding a [inexpensive] paperback at The Tattered Cover, I splurged the ninety-eight cents. And it was a ninety-eight cents well spent. Benson isn't Wodehouse, but then, who is? What Benson has is his own idea about the English and their manners, or what passes for manners in his idealized and satirical version of small town high society. Mrs. Emmeline Lucas--Lucia to all in the small town of Riseholme--rules her town with a iron will. She is the arbiter of all things cultural. But when Olga Bracely, the opera star, decides to take up residence in Riseholme, Lucia discovers that her thin veneer of culture can't stand up to the real thing. Watching Lucia get her comeuppance, and then re-win her social throne, is the main plot of the book. But there's also Daisy Quantock's Guru, and the mysterious medium, and the imperious Lady Ambermere, and the rest of Riseholme. Like Wodehouse, Benson has created characters that seem very familiar, and yet aren't typical stereotypes, and the fun is watching how they play against each other.",4.0,The knives are so sharp because the town is so small,1031788800.0,"09 12, 2002"

A1E9FUXNFS8EHC,B00DC9SWWE,patrickdom,"[1, 2]","Unfortunately, like many of the multi-player online oriented games these days, this one is also developed for today's zero attention span youth.  Basically, this is another run around shoot, die, respawn, repeat every 20 seconds.  Respawn is the perfect name for the studio that created this game, as that's what you spend all your time doing.I was really hoping for something a little closer to Mechwarrior of the PC days, but this game doesn't quite have the same level of depth, in terms of combat that lasts more than five seconds.  The maps are too small for the number of players included in the matches and I found there is little balance in terms of assigning you to a game.  While I was trying to work my way up to a meager level seven, my matches were full of people with levels 25+.  This sucks for those starting out, because each level you move up, you get better weapons and more options, so you are getting absolutely destroyed repeatedly by players far better equipped than you.  The game seems to count on the fact that you will just be content with respawn die, respawn die, respawn die for hours on end because even if you don't really accomplish anything, you get rewarded and advance for finishing rounds.  If you are content to serve as some 14 year old's pinata for about 30 hours, you might advance far enough in gear and weapons that you can last a sufficient amount of time for the game to be fun, but my time is valuable to me and I'm sure I want to spent much more of it playing this game.I'm no newbie to FPS games, but I really miss the days of games like Unreal Tournament where a match could last a half hour and you might get killed about a dozen times in a half hour.  The gameplay was such that you actually had to use strategy and the maps large enough to need it.  (Old guy sighs and thinks about nickel ice cream cones).  In this game, you die about every 30 seconds, depending on how crappy your luck is in where you respawn.  Sometimes you get in your Titan and (there is a three or four second animation each time you do) your shields are already down to almost nothing because some other player was pumping shots into you while the animation was running and there is nothing you can do.  Die, respawn, repeat.I'm sure this would be an excellent game if you were unemployed and had all day to devote to leveling up and pefecting your skills but I play games like this just to unwind at the end of the day instead of TV and I found it far more frustrating than fun.  There is too much emphasis on pleasing the Ritalin/Adderol generation who need to get an &#34;accomplishment&#34; (i.e. new weapons or upgrades) every level vs. balancing the game so that it's actually fun for new players.  Weapons are too powerful so that when running through the map, you are killed by someone you never even saw, and the instant replay shows a sequence that looked like your opponent pumping about seven shots into you and you only heard one before you were dead.I'm sure this review will have many disagreeing and saying that if I was just better at the game, it would be more fun.  That is true to a point, but I've played enough FPS games to know that this game is really not well balanced.

Muller takes readers deep into the alligator infested swampland of bayou country, where Remy and his ex-wife desperately search for their teenage daughter who has mysteriously disappeared. Set in a rural Louisiana parish richly steeped in culture, heritage, and superstition, the locale itself is filled with conflict and described in such rich multisensory detail that it becomes a complex character in and of itself, welcoming in some ways and antagonistic in others.Houston Homicide Detective Remy Steinberg loathes returning to Louisiana, the home he left behind years ago that holds nothing for him now but memories of bitterness and regret. Although the bayou will still prove to be a hindrance in his quest to find his daughter, Remy will also discover that this place still has a strong hold over him as well. During his stay with his ex-wife Gabby, he is reminded of all the good times he and Gabby shared, and he realizes that although he physically left the bayou behind, his heart has always remained here with Gabby and his daughter, Adrienne.The contention between Gabby and Remy is thick when they reunite, and it becomes clear very quickly why their marriage failed &#8211;the lack of clear communication combined with Remy&#8217;s stubborn pride and Gabby&#8217;s quick-temperedness. Once they begin their joint search, they realize they must work through their issues if they are to make  any significant progress in finding Adrienne. Both behave in some pretty frustrating ways at times, so that I can understand why they couldn&#8217;t always get along. However, unlike before, this time, they cannot just go their separate ways, not until they get Adrienne back.  Despite their communication problems, the love between Remy and Gabby still lingers, and as their partnership becomes stronger, so does the intimacy between them. Their rekindled romance is mildly sensual, and the details of their love scenes are not graphically depicted. The emphasis is more on Remy&#8217;s and Gabby&#8217;s feelings and emotions rather than the physical connection.Gabby and Remy&#8217;s relationship never overshadows or detracts from the novel&#8217;s main plot focus: to find Adrienne. In fact, all of the story threads &#8211; dark voodoo practices, illegal drug running, corrupt police officials, and swampland predators are smoothly entwined to create a well-executed plot filled with danger and suspense. The story has a clear and satisfying resolution that I must admit also left me with a craving for a big bowl of spicy Jambalaya!I received a complimentary copy of this book in exchange for an honest review.",4.0,Very Good Romantic Suspense with Paranormal Elements,1396915200.0,"04 8, 2014"

It helps maintain normal muscle and nerve function, keeps heart rhythm steady, supports a healthy immune system, and keeps bones strong. Magnesium also helps regulate blood sugar levels, promotes normal blood pressure, and is known to be involved in energy metabolism and protein synthesis. There is an increased interest in the role of magnesium in preventing and managing disorders such as hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes.Magnesium is present in all cells of the body. It is a mineral that is critical for energy production and metabolism, muscle contraction, nerve impulse transmission, and bone mineralization. It helps to regulate calcium transport and absorption. By stimulating the secretion of calcitonin, it aids the influx of calcium into bone and promotes optimal bone mineralization. It has been called nature's calcium channel blocker.

Magnesium L-Threonate supplements are not reviewed here, but are reviewed separately.MAGNESIUM RICH FOODS: Green leafy vegetables such as spinach, nuts, seeds, unsweetened cocoa, dried seaweed, dried coriander, and dried basil.PRICE PER PILL: Bluebonnet Nutrition Albion Chelated Magnesium ($.17 per gel cap) is the most expensive per pill of those in the comparison; followed by Life Extension Magnesium Caps ($.15 per capsule); followed by Thorne Research Magnesium Citrate ($.13 per gel cap); followed by JigSaw Magnesium w/SRT ($.12 per tablet) and Solgar Magnesium Citrate ($.12 per gel cap); followed by Doctor's Best High Absorption 100% Chelated Magnesium ($.07 per tablet) and Now Foods Magnesium Capsules (400 mgs)($.07 per capsule); and followed by Now Foods Magnesium Citrate (200 mgs)($.05 per tablet), which is the least expensive per pill of those in the comparison.PRICE PER 100 MGS MAGNESIUM: JigSaw Magnesium w/SRT ($.10 per 100 mgs magnesium) and Bluebonnet Nutrition Albion Chelated Magnesium ($.10 per 100 mgs magnesium)are the most expensive per 100 mgs of magnesium of those in the comparison; followed by Thorne Research Magnesium Citrate ($.09 per 100 mgs magnesium); followed by Doctor's Best High Absorption 100% Chelated Magnesium ($.07 per 100 mgs magnesium); followed by Solgar Magnesium Citrate ($.06 per 100 mgs magnesium); followed by Life Extension Magnesium Caps ($.03 per 100 mgs magnesium); and followed by Now Foods Magnesium Citrate (200 mgs)($.02 per 100 mgs magnesium) and Now Foods Magnesium Capsules (400 mgs)($.02 per 100 mgs magnesium), which are the least expensive per 100 mgs of magnesium of those in the comparison.SOY/GMO/CHOLESTEROL CONTENT: None of these products contain soy, GMOs, or cholesterol.STEARATES: Doctor's Best High Absorption 100% Chelated Magnesium, Now Foods Magnesium Citrate (200 mgs), Now Foods Magnesium Capsules (400 mgs), Solgar Magnesium Citrate, Bluebonnet Nutrition Albion Chelated Magnesium, and Swanson Albion Chelated Magnesium contain stearates. Nutrigold Magnesium Gold, JigSaw Magnesium w/SRT, Life Extension Magnesium Caps, and Thorne Research Magnesium Citrate do not contain stearates.CERTIFIED KOSHER: Solgar Magnesium Citrate and Bluebonnet Nutrition Albion Chelated Magnesium are the only products in this group that are certified Kosher. Look for the Kosher certification (called a ""Hechsher"") on the label.CHELATED: Nutrigold Magnesium Gold, JigSaw Magnesium w/SRT, Doctor's Best High Absorption 100% Chelated Magnesium, Now Foods Magnesium Citrate (200 mgs), Life Extension Magnesium Caps, Thorne Research Magnesium Citrate, Bluebonnet Nutrition Albion Chelated Magnesium, and Swanson Albion Chelated Magnesium are chelated. Now Foods Magnesium Capsules (400 mgs) and Solgar Magnesium Citrate are not chelated. A chelated form of magnesium tends to provide the highest levels of absorption and bioavailability.ENTERIC COATING: None of these supplements are enteric coated. However, JigSaw Magnesium w/SRT offers a time release formula, called ""SRT,"" which stands for Sustained Release Technology. JigSaw claims that with SRT, instead of the magnesium being dumped into your system all at once, SRT slows down the release of magnesium so it's spread out over 8 hours, which allows your body to absorb what it needs. SRT is an excellent feature and only JigSaw Magnesium w/SRT has it.MEALS: Magnesium supplements are best taken with a meal containing some fat, as they are more efficiently absorbed when taken with food.BLUEBONNET TRANSPARENCY ISSUE: The magnesium contained in Bluebonnet Nutrition Albion Chelated Magnesium is buffered. It is a 50-50 blend of magnesium glycinate and magnesium oxide. It is my understanding that this magnesium glycinate - magnesium oxide blend is purchased by Bluebonnet from Albion Laboratories. Magnesium oxide is an inferior form of magnesium in terms of absorption. The inclusion of magnesium oxide could impair the bio-availability of this product. The problem arises because Bluebonnet has failed to disclose, on its label, website or product page, that it contains magnesium oxide. This is a clear deception by Bluebonnet that creates a serious transparency issue for the company. Despite this deception and undisclosed adulteration, Bluebonnet sells this product at a premium price above almost all others.SWANSON TRANSPARENCY ISSUE: Swanson lists magnesium oxide in the ""other ingredients"" section. This is misleading because it implies that only small quantities of magnesium oxide are used, as if it were a processing aid. This is incorrect, because magnesium oxide is a significant part of the Swanson Albion Chelated Magnesium formula and it has an established ""daily value,"" which means it should be listed INSIDE the supplement facts panel. I view this as misleading and, therefore, I believe Swanson has a transparency issue.OPINION: In my opinion, all of these magnesium supplements are good, with the exception of those made in whole or in part of magnesium oxide, which I rate poorly. I would go with a chelated magnesium glycinate or magnesium malate product. Consequently, I deducted one star from Solgar Magnesium Citrate, Nature Made High Potency Magnesium, and Now Foods Magnesium Capsules (400 mgs) because they are not chelated; I deducted one star from Life Extension Magnesium Caps because it is partly magnesium oxide and it is expensive and over-priced; I deducted two more stars from Nature Made High Potency Magnesium because it is magnesium oxide; I deducted one star from Bluebonnet Nutrition Albion Chelated Magnesium because it contains stearates and it is extremely expensive and over-priced; I deducted three more stars from Bluebonnet Nutrition Albion Chelated Magnesium because it is partly magnesium oxide, the company failed to disclose magnesium oxide content in the product's supplement facts panel, the company stonewalled and refused to answer repeated inquiries about the magnesium oxide content of the product, and the company lacks transparency; and I deducted three stars from Swanson Albion Chelated Magnesium because it is partly magnesium oxide, it contains stearates, and the company lacks transparency.Based upon my analysis, in my opinion, Nutrigold Magnesium Gold, Doctor's Best High Absorption 100% Chelated Magnesium, and JigSaw Magnesium w/SRT are the best performers in this comparison. However, JigSaw Magnesium w/SRT is not only expensive, but its price fluctuates greatly from day to day; sometimes it's $39.99 per bottle and sometimes its $28.50 per bottle. I'm not impressed with its price instability.RATING:I rated Nutrigold Magnesium Gold, Doctor's Best High Absorption 100% Chelated Magnesium, JigSaw Magnesium w/SRT, and Thorne Research Magnesium Citrate five stars.I rated Now Foods Magnesium Citrate (200 mgs) four stars because it is magnesium citrate and it contains stearates.I rated Now Foods Magnesium Capsules (400 mgs) three stars because it is partly magnesium oxide and it is not chelated.I rated Solgar Magnesium Citrate four stars because it is magnesium citrate, it is not chelated, and it contains stearates.I rated Life Extension Magnesium Caps four stars because it is partly magnesium oxide.I rated Bluebonnet Nutrition Albion Chelated Magnesium one star because it contains stearates, it is extremely expensive and over-priced for a magnesium oxide blend, it is partly magnesium oxide, the company failed to disclose magnesium oxide content in the product's supplement facts panel, the company stonewalled and refused to answer repeated inquiries about the magnesium oxide content of the product, and the company lacks transparency.I rated Swanson Albion Chelated Magnesium two stars because it is partly magnesium oxide, it contains stearates, and the company lacks transparency.I have separately reviewed all of these products.Prices current as of 06/15/2014.",2.0,Swanson Albion Chelated Magnesium vs Nine Leading Magnesium Supplements,1388620800.0,"01 2, 2014"

Its hard to believe its been 10 years since the first Nightfall book, however, after reading this one its also hard to believe that there will be any more novel length stories featuring this character.This story starts a few weeks after the end of the first book when Nightfall (aka Sudian) is recovering from his injuries sustained in his fight against the sorcerer Gilleran.  Sudian is now Chancellor of Alyndar though in his ignorance of the nobility and its ways he is also dangerously lacking in knowledge of what that entails - and nobody seems to have been smart enough to enlighten him.Shortly thereafter while in a neighbouring kingdom, while Sudian is away on an errand, King Edward is kidnapped with Sudian the only survivor of his entourage and the natural scapegoat for Edward's disappearance and the scene is set for the return of Nightfall.I enjoyed this novel.  It is another story featuring the character Nightfall and in this book we get to know more about his way of life and various aliases before he met Edward, as Sudian/Nightfall combed the known world looking for him.While maybe this book doesn't have quite the tension of the first novel, which had Nightfall's soul at stake throughout its length - this is still an enjoyable, light fantasy read and I was happy to return to the world of Nightfall if only for this last time, though it should be mentioned, as the kidnapped character Edward only has small, though vital, part in this story.

I needed to catch up on my reading counts points but just couldn't get into any of the books on the list and was trying to figure out a plan to barter with other students to take some quizzes for me in exchange for me taking some for them. My friend's mom suggest reading the Harry Potter books. My mom went out and bought all three. I hadn't been into reading since The Goosebumps. Harry Potter reawakened a passion for reading in me. I read all three books in one week on summer break. Yes, I did nothing but read.At that time I went to a faith-based school, but I was running as far away from God as my legs could take me. Even through these rough years, I clung to the HP books like a life vest. Then when I came back to God and really started seeking Christ I saw all the parallels light up in the books (this was pre-book 7). Reading Harry Potter helped me understand and unlock areas in the Bible I never got before. HP made reading the Bible less scary and more of an adventure.That being said, I can 100% back John Granger's argument that God is all over HP and can be a tool used to bring people (especially the more resistant) to faith, not push them into the occult. (I didn't even know what the occult was until I learned what is was from fellow Christians who wouldn't read the books, kind of ironic).Anyway, I recommend this book to all serious HP fans. It is a great way to dig deeper into the meaning and structure behind the books. Makes me want to go back to school and get a literary degree. ;)Happy reading!Oh, and listen to John Granger's podcast: MuggleNet Academia. It is AMAZING! I am getting a literary degree for free!

And in this context a modern reader may find some novelty in how far the genre has come through the intervening decades. But time has not been kind to Asimov's style or treatment of his subject. Other readers have noted the numerous shortcomings of The Foundation. I only add that this epic tale spans the galaxy across hundreds of years and&#8212;unbelievably&#8212;female characters are presented only momentarily as an afterthought. The few brief appearances women do make they are marked as literal props for male characters. This is not to accuse Asimov of anything overtly sexist. He was undoubtedly crafting his stories within the limits of his time. But it's a total distraction to the reader.

Losier explains why doubts cancel out your best intentions. This book has many worksheets which makes it more practical.As someone who reads 180 books a year I can say that at times I like to read a small book that gets to the main points quickly and teaches me one or two new things I hadn't thought of before. This book covers the following topics:How to Identify Your Main DesiresHow to Create Desire StatementsHow to Get Rid of Limiting Beliefs and DoubtsWhile some may argue that this is just a summary of other people's teachings, Michael J. Losier gives credit where credit is due. He doesn't pretend to have thought up this idea on his own. Instead he adds to the teachings by explaining how affirmations may be hurting you instead of helping you. He literally shows you how to reword your affirmations so that they become powerful and effective.You are where you are in life because of the thoughts you have dwelt on whether positive or negative. So it is always useful to read a book that teaches you how to think in a positive way. One of the most interesting sections in the book explains how you can teach this law to children. If you are very positive and still have been attracting negative people into your life this book also presents some revealing facts.If you are very interested in this subject here is a list of books on the Law of Attraction that I think you will enjoy (they explore the subject more deeply):The Secret of The Secret: Unlocking the Mysteries of the Runaway BestsellerThe SecretThe Science of Wallace D.

The stories in this book make me think not.  Human greed is just too powerful.Jared Diamond tackles that issue on in his work ""Collapse"".  Some societies do respond and save themselves from grave challenges while others do not.  ""Internal Combustion"" is all about private gain over public needs.  And as long as corporations control our world our demise is assured. The US Supreme Court just put another nail in the coffin with it's latest decision on giving corporations unlimited access to buying politicians.""Internal Combustion"" makes it plain that public policy issues are not shaped by the facts, the science or the best interests of the public.  Money and power will corrupt the process unless reasonable limits are imposed on the process.I would say that the value of this work is that it presents case studies in the history of American energy and transportation development.As to was there an industrial conspiracy against Edison and Ford in the development of a cheap electrical automobile, this book does not provide answers to the question that it hints about.  Did major US corporations conspire to eliminate public transit in American cities?  The answer there is clearer.These questions are more important in the context of our world than when the events in question transpired.  Electric or internal combustion was not as big an issue in 1914.  However, an electric car was a more economical means of transportation if it could be made to be competitive with the gas engine.  But corporations stood to make more money on internal combustion.  Making more money is the recurrent theme in American corporate life.  And ""supersize"" it.  That will mean bigger tires, the use of more fuel and more parts?

A2U49LUUY4IKQQ,B000002OG0,"Peter Durward Harris ""Pete the music fan""","[7, 7]","Joe Ely was (and still is) a hugely talented singer and musician who always did things his way. In the late seventies, he recorded three classic country-rock albums. His debut album was untitled, while his third was Down on the drag. In between came this one, which was the best of the lot. Joe's music did not fit easily into any radio station's play list, being too country for rock and too rock for country, but he did visit the UK a few times during the late seventies and acquired a cult following, although it seems that the main interest lies in those first three albums and, to a lesser extent, the fourth album, Musta notta gotta lotta.Joe Ely wrote many of his own songs but also recorded some fine covers. Often these covers were of songs by fellow country-rockers Butch Hancock and Jimmie Dale Gilmore, both of whom have reciprocated by covering Joe's songs. Thus, this album is made up five songs by Joe, three by Butch, one by Jimmie and just one other song, the Hank Williams classic Honky tonkin', which is ideally suited to Joe's style.The musicians are Joe Ely (acoustic guitar), Lloyd Maines (steel guitar), Steve Keeton (drums), Gregg Wright (bass), Ponty Bone (accordion and piano), Jess Taylor (electric and acoustic guitar), Chip Young (electric and acoustic guitar), Shane Keister (Moog and acoustic piano) and Farrell Morris (percussion). There aren't many singers who would use such a selection of instruments, but that's what makes Joe's music so distinctive.Cornbread moon is a great up-tempo song to open the set. Because of the wind is a beautiful ballad. Boxcars is a bluesy train song. Jericho (your walls must come tumbling down) is a great upbeat song with biblical metaphors. Tonight I'm gonna go downtown is a wistful ballad. Honky tonk masquerade is a great cheating song. I'll be your fool is a wonderful ballad. Fingernails is a great song about playing the piano. The brilliant blues-rocker and pianist, Marcia Ball, later covered Fingernails for her album, Blue house. West Texas waltz always, a lightweight, fun song, reminds me of Lucille, the Kenny Rogers classic, because of some similarities in parts of the melodies. Play them back-to-back and you'll understand what I mean. Honky tonkin' rounds off the album brilliantly.If you only buy one Joe Ely album - indeed, if you only buy one country-rock album - make it this one.

The people who have sacrificed their innocence, their trust in a benevolent world, and often their health, to assure our comfort and ignorance?This is about an ordinary woman, a childhood friend of our hero, who was first afraid to love him, and then afraid to face who he'd become when he finally returned home. You experience the town's perfectly rational fears as they debate whether to allow the hero back into their lives - he could be dangerous, you know.

Professor Mark Wheeler looks into the phenomenon, which is most evident in the U.S., but is also becoming more common in the U.K. and around the world. In this book, he looks mostly at the U.S. and the U.K.The book is laid out like an academic text, so do yourself a favor and skip the introduction and even the first chapter in which he explains with numerous citations and footnotes, what he intends to tell you. I almost quit reading the book when I got bogged down in references and stilted sentences. But by the second chapter, he loosens up a bit and talks about the &#34;celebritization&#34; of politicians (Bill Clinton, Barack Obama) and the politicization of celebrities (George Clooney, Angelina Jolie) and how both sides seem to benefit from the convergence of the two. Obama's endorsement from Oprah Winfrey was so helpful to his campaign in 2008 that it's possible he would not have won without it.Wheeler provides historical context, reminding us that this isn't something new. Even Abraham Lincoln was a celebrity in his day.And there are limits to the benefits for the players. Just as movie stars don't like the camera around all the time, politicians want the press there when it suits them and get upset when they don't have complete control over their message. And the celebrities have only so much influence when it comes to their endorsements and causes.

A24R8J54OJA35T,0385327439,"Allyn ""pianogirl""","[2, 2]","Sixteen-year old Sammie Davis is smack-dab in the middle of a full-blown crisis. Not only have her parents (whom she felt would ""always"" stay together) divorced; her once-best-friend father is now journeying out west to complete a university sabbatical (far from their home state of New York) and Sammie is to live with her mother in New York City, as her mother attempts to finish an art degree. Sammie boils with resentment. What's she to do with a mother who's hooked on self-esteem books and in the depths of depression over her divorce? What about her almost friendless, boring existence in NYC? What to do about former ""best-friend-forever"", Kitty Lundquist, the popularity queen whose selfishness Sammie is finding more and more annoying, especially since Sammie has now made friends with quirky, loyal, and fun Phoebe? And last, yet far, far from least, what should Sammie do about her growing attraction to her mother best friend's son, the guitar-playing, tree-hugging Eli?OK, good news first. The best thing about this book is that Carolyn Mackler truly does seem to identify with teenagers and create a fairly true-to-life character. With the exception of the discussion about and the actual dealing with boy/boyfriend troubles, I understood what Sammie was going through and found that I identified with many of her experiences. (I don't have a boyfriend; too happy and busy for one, thank you very much :-)). Furthermore, Mackler's humor, infused throughout the character of Sammie, was REALLY funny. For example, how can you not laugh when Sammie refers to her chest as the ""Grand Tetons"" and likens her popular friend to a ""sports car"" and herself to a ""Ford Taurus?"" But despite these solid aspects of ""Love and Other Four-Letter Words,"" the was a major problem at the root of the story-it was incredibly cliched. With other ""I'm-just-an-ordinary-teenager-but-I-can-be-the-heroine-of-a-book"" stories around (think Louise Rennison's ""Angus, Thongs, and Full Frontal Snogging,"" Meg Cabot's ""The Princess Diaries,"" and Joan Bauer's ""Hope Was Here""), this book really did just seem like more of the same. It is truly one of those books that I will probably not even remember six months from now, simply because it is soooooo similar to soooo much of the other pulp that is said to be young adult ""literature.""

Searching online may be simple but sometimes information can get a little sketchy and it helps if you have destination experts to give you the inside tips about the areas that you are visiting or were thinking of visiting.Since 1949, Fodor's guides have been giving travelers the best, honest guidance to travelers.  In fact, the publication has gone as far back when Hungarian Eugene Fodor has been traveling the world and felt he should start his own publication because the other guidebooks out there were so boring and were outdated.With over 440 guides published of 330 destinations, needless to say that if you are going to the Caribbean, Fodor's ""U.S. & British Virgin Islands"" is the one and only guide that I recommend.  The guide goes into destinations and breaks them apart for those who are interested in visiting the beach, diving and snorkeling, knowing the history of the U.S. Virgin Islands, where to sleep in style, etc.Want the most expensive food?  What to know how much you should tip?  Fodor answers ""Frequently Asked Questions"" in their guide.  But what if you are traveling to a certain part of the Carribean?  No problem.  The guide book gives you the information you need to know the best choice for hotels, restaurants, places to visit for those who plan to visit St. Thomas, St. John, Tortola, Virgin Gorda and even other British Virgin Islands such as Jost Van Dyke, Guana Island, Marina Cay, Anegada, Peter Island, Necker Island and Cooper Island.And it helps that the people writing the guidebook live in the area.  Carl M. Bareuther lives in St. Thomas and Lynda Lohr lives in St. John.  So, this is not someone who lives in a big metropolitan city basing their book off what they read off the Internet.There are maps for destinations, information if you need to rent a car, how to get around, essentials, where to eat, need to go to the post office, night life to shopping areas.

Check your device and motherboard's interface connector types before ordering.  I first tried using it with the right-angled connector to the motherboard interface but it would not clear an electronic component, so I switched it around.  Then, the right-angled connector attached to the rear of the SATA DVD drive would not clear the Ultra-IDE DVD drive installed beneath it (the SATA drive is shorter than the IDE drive by about 3/4"").  So, I switched the locations of the DVD drives and the problem was solved.  In the future, I will order straight connectors on both ends...

If you're new to reading period pieces, not a literature major or haven't read/or have read but didn't enjoy Jane Austen, the Brontes, F. Scott Fitzgerald, Edith Wharton, Henry James, etc. and want a clean (no sex or vulgarity), fast-paced novel about a another time with a little twist at the end, this book may be for you.It was not for me. I found it flat, derivative, sterotypical, with no character development.I would have kept my two cents to myself except that I wanted to express two things. One, that in writing you should stick to what you know and Ms. Morton admits in her Author's Note that she knew nothing about this time period and had to do research. Not surprisingly, her present-day main character, Grace, is the best developed character. When we go back in time we encounter one-dimensional sterotypes and recycled everything. But then, this book is wildly popular so if Ms. Morton were to stick to the time period she knows her fans would probably be dissapointed.Two, I didn't appreciate the 'borrowing' of characters and other aspects of well-known books and tv shows. Maybe Ms. Morton intended it as a tribute but reading the dialogue of the cook, Mrs. Townsend and the butler, Mr. Hamilton, for example, and finding that they spoke word-for-word what Mrs. Bridges and Hudson from Upstairs Downstairs would have said, just seemed like 'taking'. And it just made for flat, near-caricatures.I wonder if Ms. Morton may later regret not sticking to what she knows and writing with more depth and originality, rather than having huge book sales. She's not a bad writer but I felt she sold herself short a little and could have worked a little harder. Maybe it's all about the market and how to get published these days...",3.0,Accessible period piece or one-dimensional derivative fiction?,1294099200.0,"01 4, 2011"
A3L37AE5JPZ97D,B0036ZE6SS,AdamMB91,"[1, 2]","Edit: Previously I had given this laptop a great review because it had been performing great. However, the video card is incredibly lackluster at the moment. The ASUS ATI 5870HD is using an obsolete vBIOS that is causing a numerous amount of problems. Also, ATI is having quite a hard time trying to fix the video cards ridiculous problems with gray screens, black screens, and vertical line crashes during video games. Right now, I'm pretty much unable to play any video games that I have on this computer until ASUS and AMD do their jobs and fix their software problems.Edit Part 2: I flashed the vBIOS and BIOS, so those problems are fixed. With those being flashed, I was able to update to the most current and game friendly ATI drivers. Everything is running smoothly. I still hate ATI though. >.>To start off, I will say this: the laptop comes with TONS of bloatware. It takes a few minutes to uninstall all of the unnecessary games, programs, and ASUS utilities, but it is perfectly fine afterward. The laptop's hard drives are partitioned very strangely. I recommend reformatting them using the ASUS recovery tool when you hit F9 while the computer is booting, then once that is finished go into Windows 7 disk management and modify the other hard drive space to your liking.The laptop itself runs very smoothly. It runs very cool and I have not had any overheating problems; I do suggest you get a laptop cooler just in case though. This laptop plays Dragon Age: Origins on full graphics and 1920x1080 resolution at around 50 FPS and 30-45 FPS in combat (this is with a bunch of Aura Effects and AoE Spells too), which is pretty good. I was quite excited to learn that this laptop runs better than my desktop computer which has a GTX260 and AMD Phenom II X4 960. What you will want to do is change power settings. When the laptop is off of the AC charger, it can kick into some super saver energy mode that you can't get out of. It will drop your CPU speed and capacity down to 5%. This is easily fixed by going into the Power4Gear options and changing the Minimum CPU speed to a higher setting.The design of the laptop is cool looking. My one big complaint about the layout is that every time you type on the built-in keyboard, you are bound to hit the humongous mouse pad. You can turn off the mouse pad whenever you plug in an external mouse though. The ergonomic design of the laptop is very nice and does feel quite comfortable. Another complaint that I have for this laptop is that even though it is quite big it does NOT have a firewire port, an Express Card slot, or an eSata port. The illuminated keypad is very nice and helpful for late night gaming.Battery Life: Don't expect to play a game for very long with the power unplugged. Sitting idle, this laptop runs out of power in ~2 hours. When I left it unplugged while transferring files to the laptop, it ran out in around ~1 hour. This computer is a big energy hog. If you want portability, you don't want a gaming laptop. This laptop is a powerhouse and as such, requires to be plugged in for optimal gaming.If you have any questions or concerns just post a comment.",4.0,"Took some tweaking, excellent laptop VIDEO PROBLEMS",1279670400.0,"07 21, 2010"

She is the sweetest ghoul ever, never mind that she must eat human flesh to survive. It gives ""fast food"" a whole new meaning, but it's only the scum of the earth that she consumes, so no big loss. I mean, what's a ghoul to do?The cast of characters is eclectic to say the least. A ghoul, a revenant priest still in love with his ex-wife, wolfling, hellhounds and other creatures, not to mention the real-life historical characters who weave in and out of the story. The characters are mostly larger than life, with egos to match, but even larger hearts.Alice and her rag-tag group of friends, in particular sisters Trish and Becca, infiltrate St. Marrok's, a school for the preternatural with a few humans thrown in (proving they're not biased - everyone has the same right to die), where the master plotters reside. The plan is to thwart The Nameless Ones from taking over the world, fight the other wannabe's along the way, and in danger all the while of President Bush pushing The Nuke Button.But first and foremost, they must stay alive.No need for too much worry, though, because Alice ""The Wentworth"" is one kick-butt ghoulfriend. Her sense of right, wrong and justice for all is highly tuned. With her super powers and the dead love of her life, Victor Standish, advising from inside her head, the ghoul can't lose.End of Days is a dark urban action-packed fantasy. A plot expertly weaved with a mix of Indian and Celtic lore, preternatural and human beings, fictional and real-life historical characters, all occupying the devasted streets of the French Quarter in the aftermath of Katrina in a post apocalyptic setting.But at the End of the Day, End of Days was about love and friendship.

I can't believe after all this time, that was the problem and that is what fixed it.It seems to be working without a glitch even writing this, and I was having issues with every word. The keys would get no response at all for several seconds, until sometimes I just had to shake the keyboard in frustration. It was so frustrating!So, that's it. Get a DONGLE and attach the adapter to it in an available USB port on your computer or from a multi port USB adapter. Seems that possibly the USB wire helps it to receive the signal much better. I've read so many blogs and issues with this and tried a few other things, but none worked, but it looks like this did resolve this connectivity issue. YES! I'm finally enjoying this great keyboard. OK, I'm really really happy about this.To those who say the esc key is small, I agree. But you easily get use to it just like you did with the bigger clunky esc key you have before getting this. You just have to familiarize yourself with all the buttons. It takes a bit, but when you get use to it, you'll be absolutely loving all the functions, despite the smaller esc and F keys.What I did to get use to where it is, I place my left hand and middle finger toward the upper left corner and there you'll find the 'back' button, just below that is the Esc button. Do it enough times, and you can find it without having to look for it. It's just a matter of repetition.I would have given this combo pack a five star rating if it weren't for the connection issues, and also I should mention, the mouse is not as responsive as I was use to when my Laser mouse died on me. This is optical, and there definitely is a difference.All in all, for the price, this is a great keyboard and mouse.Hope this all works for you!",4.0,ATTENTION those with connectivity Issues.,1311120000.0,"07 20, 2011"

This game is no exception , from start to finish the game had me so enthralled in the story I just didn't want to stop playing..If you are one of those people that think this game is just a game of quick time events ( QTE ) you would be completely wrong.. You have to initiate the QTE .. The fighting machanics of this game can be easily compaired to the batman games , they are fast and fluid.. You will need to rely heavily on your blocking/shield , without it you will die very quickly. Once you get the block , stagger , and attack combonations down its pretty much smooth sailing from there on out.. Im not saying it's completely easy from there but everything is alot more managable after you get everything down. YOU WILL STILL DIE THROUGH OUT THE GAME !! You will run into hords of ememies that at some points seem overwhelming , but after you die a few times you will see the things you are doing wrong and correct it.The graphics are nothing but amazing in this game and simply something that could not be accomplished with the previous generation ( Xbox 360 , PS3 ) . Everything is just so detailed and beautiful to look at. I have found that after clearing an area of enemies I like to stop and just look around and appreciate the surroundings I am playing in..In my opinion this game is nearly flawless and deserves nothing less than a 5 out of 5.. Don't listen to the paid professional reviews , if you want a real honest and truthful review , just read the user reviews.. There have been so many times I have seen profesional reviews really trounce on a game and give it poor reviews but doesnt reflect the actual user reviews that are much higher. One of the worst reviews I have ever seen was  by Adam Sessler from G4 tv reviewing Darksiders.. I can't remember exactly what score he gave it but he gave either a one or two star review.. That was a totally inacurate review of the game.Darksiders II Xbox 360Look at the actual user reviews. What I'm trying to tell you is to look for yourself and play the games you want instead of listening to the '"" professional "" reviews.. As a matter of fact Sessler even gave this game a bad review and even admitted in his review he didn't complete the game..On a final note , just pick up the game and play it if you are interested , it really is an excellent game and one that you will always remember..",5.0,Just what I expected from Crytek !!!,1389225600.0,"01 9, 2014"
A109R3OJVXPC9E,B00005NZD5,"""redandy_99""","[2, 2]","It is finally time to replace my Crystal Arome coffee maker... with another one.  I really like this coffee maker.The features are great.  First there is the automatic timer - good for having coffee brewed the moment you get out of bed.  Then there is the auto-shutoff which is great for those who rush out the door in a hurry.  It can also be set to one, two or three hours - another great feature.Finally, my favorite feature is the design.  Not only do guests say &quot;Wow, cool coffee maker,&quot; but the round carafe that is mostly enclosed enables a lower temerature to be used to keep the coffee warm.  This GREATLY reduces that burnt coffee taste you get with many inferior machines.The only troubles I have had with it was an early design flaw that caused some dribbling while pouring (that has been corrected) and now some electronics problems.  About a year ago I noticed the LCD starting to go and now it will occassionally stay on longer than the auto-shutoff is supposed to allow.I think six years is a good lifespan for a coffee maker and I have been quite satisfied with this one and am back to purchase another.",4.0,Six years later...,1006992000.0,"11 29, 2001"

Mathis,"[1, 1]","I wanted a way to keep my camera just a little safer at Burning Man, which has a harsh environment full of fine, pervasive alkaline dust, but is also one of the most photogenic places on earth.  I know there's no way to keep my camera completely dust-free, and this product is mainly protection against minor impact and not necessarily environment, but I didn't want to go out there without any protection at all.It's made of the kind of material that easily collects lint, so I was worried that it would get caked with dust, but that wasn't too much of a problem. I kept the armor on for the entire event, and it made cleanup a lot easier when I got home. After I removed it, I rinsed it off with some mild soap and warm water and it's good to go. I used a cotton swab to clean off the exposed areas of my camera, and that's all it needed. (Always swap lenses inside a car or other protected area down there to protect your sensor.)I was still able to use all of the camera functions and change the battery and memory card and tripod mount without any problems. Using the covered buttons takes some getting used to, but I was willing to work with it and it served me well.I was especially glad for the plastic LCD screen cover, which I didn't expect when I opened the box. At first I considered leaving it off, but it proved worthwhile when I saw how the rubber part of the armor sealed against it, keeping gypsum dust completely out of the controls on the back of the camera. This proved to be the most valuable part of the armor - I can't imagine having to dig dust out from around those buttons. I'm not sure it would have survived. And my LCD came out without a scratch!I didn't bother with the piece that goes around the front of the lens. It wouldn't work as protection against dust, but may come in handy for impacts and might be useful as a small lens hood in a pinch.For the price, this was a fantastic piece of insurance for my camera body, and it'll get used again when I'm camping or backpacking or at the beach. Love it!This isn't the kind of thing you want to deal with in the studio, but if you dig shooting in the great outdoors, don't leave home without it.Pros: price, ease of use, good protectionCons: Nothing to complain about - it simply is what it is!",4.0,Exactly what I needed.,1221868800.0,"09 20, 2008"
AKKL84HND6350,0812982150,,"[0, 0]","Tracy Kidder and Richard Todd provide a wonderful overview of the writing process. I initial bought the book because I am interested in creative nonfiction as a genre for research and study. While the book does contain some general information on the genre itself, its strength is definitely in helping to teach writing. This is made clear in the introduction: &#34;Good Prose is addressed to readers and writers, to people who care about writing, about how it gets done, about how to do it better. That you can learn to write better is one of our fundamental assumptions&#34; (xvi). And this last line definitely holds true throughout. I never got the impression from the book that either of them saw writing well as something confined to a special group of people. The general sense of the book is that writing well comes from persistence rather than from natural inclination.The book is well organized and includes a section on English usage, a bibliography to point readers to more resources, and an index. One of the strengths of this book is its use of examples, particularly the writing lives of other people, the problems they faced and how those problems work both for and against them. Considering my particular interest, the chapters on memoirs and essays were the most useful. However, I especially appreciated the bibliography as a recommendation for other books for further study.Probably my only complaint in terms of it being a book on writing is that it is a bit general, more big picture. However, that is a good thing if it is what you are looking for. If not, they do provide other resources for the reader to find, such as Fowler's Modern English Usage.

This time around, Kara investigates the strange murder of a rich and powerful member of her southern Louisiana town. The trophy wife is the obvious suspect, but, once Kara discovers that the victim's essence was ripped out, the arcane come into play. The mystery unfolds in exciting, action-paced twists that thicken with each page. As the body count rises and more victims have their essences ripped out, Kara must get to the bottom of the crime while juggling a growing relationship with her partner and the continued attention of a sexy demon lord.Even better than Mark of the Demon, Diana Rowland spins a wonderful and exciting tale. Rowland's writing abilities have certainly sharpened since her previous novel, as has her ability to overcome some of the small issues in the Mark of the Demon. The summoning world becomes more strongly developed, and the characters' relationships and personalities grow. I particularly liked Kara because -even more than other female characters out there, and more-so than in the previous novel -I felt like I could relate to her somewhat. She felt like a realistic character rather than the perfect butt-kicking heroine or angsty character who was always complaining about something. Kara exhibited a wide range of real, believable emotions that made her a multi-dimensional character.Kara's relationship to the sexy demon lord Rhyzkahl also progresses (and I was concerned that this wouldn't happen for the sake of keeping mystery for no real reason). I would have liked to have seen a stronger focus on it though and hoped for answers to all the questions surrounding Rhyzkahl -but at least the steamy romance scenes helped make up for it!A noticeable improvement from the previous novel, Blood of the Demon is perfect for fans of paranormal romance and police procedural.

A3MIAZCG576G35,B005LVDE8S,Nikiforos V. Skoumas,"[1, 1]","""Century"" is the brand new, debut solo album by Swedish singer Chris Antblad, the former voice of melodic rockers ""Spin Gallery"". The release of ""Century"" has already suffered delays as the album was completed by 2008. As you would expect, Antblad's solo effort is not that far away from his previous works, since ""Century"" falls perfectly within the AOR genre.In fact ""Century"" puts forward a very light style of melodic rock; subtle rhythm section, harmonious keyboards and few lead guitar parts (however, making their presence felt on the final songs). One has to agree that the album has radio potential thanks to its sweet-sugary choruses and easy-listening arrangements. The keyboards actually are positioned in front of the guitars in the mix, delivering the majority of melodies commonly utilizing a synth/electronic sound.Clearly the album offers a good handful of melodic rock highlights in ""A fire burning"", ""Get in the car"", ""I'm gonna make you mine"" and the title track, never forgetting the up-tempo rocker ""Jealous eyes"" clearly a standout. For that matter, one has to give credit to Chris and co for making ""Century"" as complete an album as possible-with a total of thirteen tracks, the Antblad debut is a rather well rounded release for fans of soft melodic rock/AOR. If you enjoy the reserved, yet just as melodic side of AOR, ""Century"" is for you.",4.0,"Solo AOR debut by the former ""Spin Gallery"" singer",1321056000.0,"11 12, 2011"
A1RAUVCWYHTQI4,0812979362,A. Ross,"[0, 0]","I'm a huge fan of mystery/crime novels set in different cultures, so I was very pleased to see this series debut from a Ghanaian author. Although many reviewers seem inclined to compare it to the very enjoyable bestselling Ladies No. 1 Detective Agency series, I don't actually think they have much in common, other than being set in the same continent. The protagonist, Darko Dawson, is a more traditional figure of crime fiction --  a big city Detective Inspector in the Ghanaian capital of Accra (population roughly 3 million). He's a devoted family man, a bit arrogant, fond of sneaking a joint behind his wife's back, and more hotheaded than someone in his position should be.Thanks to his language skills, he's been detailed to investigate the murder of a bright young medical student in a small village several hours inland. In an unfortunately large coincidence, this also happens to be a village he has relatives in, as well as being the last place his mother was seen alive, some 25 years ago. What follows is a fairly traditional police procedural -- albeit one derailed by various impediments unknown in Western settings. It seems the victim was involved in AIDS awareness education, which brought her into conflict with a local priest/shaman and the practice of ""trokosi,"" whereby families give females to the priest as lifetime slaves in exchange for his spiritual intercession in an important matter.Although the writing is often clunky and flat, the contrast between village and city, the modern and the traditional, is quite illuminating. As with many mystery series debuts, the main enjoyment doesn't come from the murder mystery (the killer is rather easily guessed), but from meeting an interesting new cast of characters whom one hopes will return for further, more intricate adventures.",4.0,Debut of a Ghanain Gumshoe,1250553600.0,"08 18, 2009"

A3EXWV8FNSSFL6,B000IOM0U6,Daniel G. Lebryk,"[1, 1]","I'm not a big fan of this film. Normally this would sit right in a sweet spot of the kind of film I love. This one, nope, didn't make the cut. I can't put my finger on it, but I seem to have seen this story before - bourgoise, spoiled rotten, bored girl; finds adventure with a Morrocan guy; they sleep together; he turns out to be a thief; she runs off with him; and things go bad.The film is a bit unsettling at first, shot in 2004 in black and white; it is supposed to have a 1970's feel to it - or set in the 1970's. I knew the DVD release was brand new, so I had to check release and filming dates - sure enough its a current film. But the director got some things a bit wrong with the era; nothing I can put my finger on specifically, but the film just wasn't perfectly 1970's. I lived in Paris at that time, and it never really felt like this film. He intercut stock footage from the period, which was all slightly out of focus and badly shot; so it stuck out like a sore thumb compared to the more modern filming.Then we move to the acting. Its all kind of cardboard, long vapid staring off into space. The lead character Lili, Isild Le Besco, spent about half her screen time staring, very much like the cover art on the DVD. She spent much of the rest drawing. And all the rest without her clothes on, or in bed. The supporting cast was pretty much just there, not a ton of dialog, not much action; they all sort of orbited around Lili, while she was sad, serious, and bored.Film wise, it is interesting to see black and white filming. But the director chose some of the worlds worst film stock to shoot on. The whole thing was grainy beyond imagination. Black and white can be sumptuous with fineness of tone, details. Instead he created a high contrast grainy mess. The editing was very sad, so many scenes should have been cut, but we remain looking at something we should have long ago stopped seeing. At an hour and 40 minutes, the film is long. At the one hour mark the film turns into almost paint drying. The last 10 minutes are decent, and do put a bow on the story.The film is shown in French with English subtitles. It is not rated, but would likely be R rated if the MPAA watched this one. There is a small amount of strong language. There is a certain amount of nudity. Isild Le Besco is not afraid to take off her clothes, and we are treated to views of her entire pretty body (they did get one thing exactly right about the 70's, a certain lack of shaving). There is one brief scene of full frontal male nudity. From the descriptions, it might seem like this is a sensual romp with Lili. In fact its kind of the opposite. Aside from her first coupling with the Morrocan guy, the sex scenes are not at all sensual. There are no explicit sex scenes at all in this film (there's a strange scene with two men where Lili twists and turns between the two of them, but nothing other than her body is visible - hardly an explicit scene). So younger viewers need not apply to watch this film.The DVD bonus features are the worst. There are several 'extended' scenes. I watched them, and honestly cannot tell what is extended. They are at best super lame. Don't even bother.My complaint with this film, it is too long and moves very slowly, there is no real romance or chemistry between the coupling characters, it was a poor attempt at capturing the film style of the 70's, the filming was down right bad (black and white has so much potential), and the story was just not interesting.

I have a Lenovo netbook that I use for travel so I use both types of computers on a regular basis.The computer itself is awesome.  The screen is great, the keyboard is comfortable -- the touchpad as an entirely different story (awkwardly placed and so big you accidentally touch it when you type -- this was going to be a non issue for me though as I had intended to use a separate mouse and disable it), and the touch screen is fairly responsive.  I personally think the sound is great since my MacBook had horrible sound (again, it was 6 years old).I played with Win8 at Fry's and it seemed tolerable - not nearly as much of a pain as I had read.  I got it home and started installing programs and whatnot only to realize that if it's not a Microsoft store app, it can be difficult to use.  I mostly got this computer because I needed something that could run Adobe Creative Suite and I REALLY didn't want to pay the Mac premium (it's ridiculous - not to mention my MacBook crashed twice so I know there's nothing superior about the units).  But, I also use my computer for chatting with friends.  The messaging app that comes installed didn't work (and only works for MSN).  I tried downloading a multi-chat app from the store and had all sorts of problems trying to get the sound off as well as trying to get my message to send when I hit enter (there's an option but it randomly switched between doing it and not).  I figured my best bet would be to download Trillian since I use that on my Lenovo.  Well, because it's not an app, it will only run in desktop mode, meaning you won't get any notifications when you're browsing the web or using another app - that is not an option for me.  I decided to use Trillian's web-based program and that's working fine, but it's not going to work for me long-term because I won't get notifications when I'm using other programs.  The whole system is a mess.  I can't blame Acer for the Win8 design flaws, but if you get the computer you're stuck with the software.Even though I say the touch screen is responsive, it's not as responsive as I was hoping.  Some clicks take a little while to register and since I'm impatient, I would click multiple times (thinking it hadn't worked) and then 10 seconds later I'd have 5 of the same thing open.With the trackpad, as I said, it's much too large and doesn't always work the way one would expect it to.  Nearly every time I open my computer, I feel like tossing it across the room.  The computer itself is solid and a good machine - if you're a techie and want to or can crack the system and install something else, good for you.  The average user is probably going to be disappointed.  I'm actually really bummed.  I wanted to like it and I felt the specs were a pretty good bang for the buck, but Win8 is just too much and not even remotely user-friendly.  For that reason, I'm going to have to return the entire computer. =(  I wish there was a better way.There is no Firefox app.  You have a choice of IE and Chrome.  You can DL Firefox but it will only run in desktop mode.  That could be an option for some - bypassing the whole Metro interface and using the computer solely in desktop - only MS Office is an app.  So if you're running Open Office, Firefox and a variety of other non-app based programs, you can probably get away with logging on and going directly to the desktop.  You won't get as much use out of the touchscreen, but it may be a solution for some.  It's not a sustainable solution for me.Only get this computer if you actually like Win8 or plan to run something else on it.  I want to stress that the computer itself is pretty fantastic - it's the software/OS that's the deal breaker.  If you can wait, wait until MS comes up with something better (I read today that they're releasing Win9 next year).",3.0,Returning,1354406400.0,"12 2, 2012"

Secos &amp; Molhados' exquisite blend of ballads, Latin rhythms and Portuguese music (the songwriter was from Portugal) took Brazil by storm in 1973. But their strongest appeal was the lead singer Ney Matogrosso, a slender frontman in his early 30's with a unique, almost female voice. What's more: a full year before Kiss released their debut album, Secos &amp; Molhados were wearing make-up (to this day, Ney Matogrosso still believes Kiss copied them after seeing them on a full-page ad in Billboard magazine, but that's another story...). The impact they had was tremendous. Barely a year later it was all over. Ironically, the group's break-up coincided with the release of their second album. The group's mentor and songwriter Joo Ricardo has tried to revive Secos &amp; Molhados with different line-ups ever since, but neither the fans nor the media ever accepted substitutes for Ney Matogrosso, who went on to become a successful singer in his own right. These are the only studio albums with the original line-up and now they're available on a single CD, with a decent booklet (a rare feature in Brazilian reiusses) and fully remixed sound.

When M&B; arrives in the mail I sit down immediately and read Rich's editorial, then set the magazine aside for a convenient time to review the remainder.Timeless Running Wisdom is like a whole book of Rich's editorials.  He presents sound, practical, effective advice on a wide variety of running topics.  His advice has a common theme, something like ""get out there and run and make it a part of your lifestyle, it is all good"".  He lets you know how to accomplish this while stripping away the non-essentials.  Rich's advice often has an old school flavor to it (he often refers to himself as a ""Luddite"" and makes the amazing admission that he typed the first draft of the book on a Royal typewriter).  He absolutely skewers running technofiles in the first chapter of the book ""Embrace Simplicity"", my favorite chapter.  (Warning - if you couldn't bear the thought of running without your beloved GPS, this book might not be for you.)  Old school or not, reading this book will make your running both more effective and more enjoyable, guaranteed.Many pairs of chapters seem to contradict each other (e.g., Chapter 11 is ""Move Up in Mileage"" and Chapter 12 is ""Move Down in Mileage"").  Rich explains convincingly there is no one-size-fits-all, and different approaches might apply depending on the specific circumstances.Rich's style is easy, down home, folksy and, I think, highly entertaining.  For example, his 5 page chapter on Study Runners and Running includes references to The Beatles, Chile's top export, the capital of South Dakota, Roger Penske and Dale Earnhardt, Jr., Wagner's Ring of the Nibelung, Wikipedia, the Badwater 135 movie classic Running on the Sun, and the list goes on.  Oh, and a couple of tinyurl's for future referene (maybe Rich isn't quite as allergic to technology as he lets on).Bonus!  Rich is buds with the Who's Who of Running - Dean Karnazes, Kathrine Switzer, Bill Rodgers, Joan Benoit Samuelson, Marshall Ulrich, and many others - and got them to provide their own perspectives on selected chapters.

We have two dogs and two cats so the vacuum came in handy when cleaning up pet hair.  We thought that this new model would be an improvement from the previous model however we were wrong.  As an upright vacuum, it is great.  However, when using the attachment tools, it  is not user friendly at all.  The hose of this model is much shorter.  The lift away feature is actually cumbersome because you have to focus holding the cannister in one hand while vacuuming with the hose in the other.  When you do leave the cannister on its own, it tips over easily.  The design is not as ergonomic as the previous model.  Not impressed with this new model and don't recommend it.

ABOWQ8GC2K34P,1456461273,mercifulmaenad,"[1, 2]","I'll start by saying I'm not Muslim (or Sufi) so my depth of knowledge is pretty shallow, really.  I am a religious studies student and I wrote my thesis on comic books.  This is a great little treasure that I found unexpectedly.  If you are Muslim, I can't really speak to how insightful or fun this book will be for you as a person of the faith.  I do know the news reports about this book said it was wildly popular with school children in Mumbai.Anyhow, the authors are two brothers who originally had a web comic and ended up combining them into a book.  They have a second book out now that I'd like to get eventually.  Rendered in simple line drawings in black and white, each page gives a new comic lesson on the left and the corresponding notes from the Qur'an and Hadith on the right.  As a casual reader, I found several good reminders for my own life even as a non-religious person.  If a Sufi comic seems like a contradiction, keep in mind there are no depictions of the Prophet as can be expected.  And, as Islam is aniconic, the Imam's faces have all been left blank.  Only the laity is represented in full in the pictures.The book is divided into Ethics, Spirituality, Philosophy, and the Existence of God and covers a lot of basic questions in Islam.  There doesn't seem to be a particularly Sufi interpretation of these topics to me but I'm woefully ignorant about Islam and Sufism, really.  If you are Muslim, you'd probably understand the nuances more.  And if you don't already know or haven't gleaned, Sufism is thought of as the &#34;mystical&#34; or &#34;inner path&#34; of Islam as I understand it.I recommend this book to anyone interested in religious studies or those who want to learn more about Islam and Sufism but only want to dip their toes in just a bit.  This is not a substitute for really learning about the faith, but it's a nice first step or supplement.  You can read it and then go watch Little Mosque on the Prairie reruns and get a basic understanding and talking points in 90 pages with a pop culture TV reference to supplement.  If, however, you're a comic book nerd, this ain't no Watchmen.  This book isn't about the art like I think the Action Bible is--it's about the lessons.  Even if you're not a faith minded person or if you're still a little nervous about all things Islam, give this book a try; I'm sure you'll find lessons and reminders for you own life, regardless of your beliefs.  It's a quick and easy read that takes a while to digest.Also, Amazon--my book arrived with a broken spine but it was still readable and seemed a shame to use so many resources to exchange for a new copy.  However, I'm still totally disappointed that it has a 1&#34; rip on all the pages in the &#34;Existence of God&#34; chapter by the spine.

A14XW8BJGEBM91,B002ZTQVBQ,Carlos E. Velasquez,"[0, 0]","What a precious film ""Ponyo"" is! The colors and its beautiful story really captivate you. Helmed by Academy Award-winning director Hayao Miyazaki, at the Japanese animation film Studio Ghibli, this astonishing movie follows the tradition established by Miyazaki and Ghibli, with wonderful animated films like ""My Neighbor Totoro,"" ""Kiki's Delivery Service,"" and ""Castle in the Sky.""One of the main characters in the story is Sosuke, a happy kid who spends his day going to school and returning home with his mother Risa, who works in a senior-care facility, which is located next door to Sosuke's school. His father, a sailor, is seldom home because his job is very time-demanding. Their house is located on a cliff in a picturesque Japanese coastal fishing village. One day, Sosuke discovers what appears to be or looks like a goldfish at the beach downhill from his house. He picks it up, puts it in a bucket with water, and names her Ponyo. However, it happens that Ponyo is the daughter of a powerful wizard and a sea Goddess.With time, the wizard takes Ponyo away from Sosuke, which breaks her heart because she loves Sosuke - and she also wants to become a human.  She escapes from her father's custody, unleashing drastic changes on our planet as a result, causing tsunamis, sending earth into pre-historic times (with its fauna and flora), and getting the moon very close to the earth, leading to possible, eventual crash. Only true love will allow the balance of nature to be restored.""Ponyo"" is just awesome. The animation is mesmerizing, as well as its attention to detail. Based on Hans Christian Andersen's classic `The Little Mermaid,"" this is a film that all the family will treasure for generations to come.

You might say I've become sissified over the years. However . . . I do make exceptions, and Unfinished Business is one of those. While many suspense authors indulge in a shockfest of over the top violence, Gligor takes the time to build the suspense, psychological rather than gut-wrenching. Like a classic Hitchcock film, the fear-turned-to terror mounts. All the while we empathize with the main character's plight. In the midst of this cozily familiar holiday, something is very wrong.

A2FS9CYCWC6HLW,1416590544,"Anna M. Ligtenberg ""AnnaLovesBooks""","[6, 7]","ISBN 1416590544 - A recipe for The Book of Unholy Mischief: A littleOliver Twist, for the child pickpockets, a bit ofThe Da Vinci Code, for the secret that could destroy The Church, and way too muchUnder the Tuscan Sun: At Home in Italy, for the really-really-really boring food strewn throughout. Set it during the Renaissance and top with things that just didn't happen during the Renaissance. Viola!Luciano, as an adult, tells the story of his childhood and his introduction to a secret group whose sole reason for being is to preserve knowledge. One of many children living on the streets of Venice, Luciano has two friends, one cat and a huge crush. He doesn't have enough to eat or a warm place to sleep until he is taken in, inexplicably, by the chef of the doge. He's not aware why he was chosen, but he appreciates the room and board that comes with his apprenticeship and he shares some of his good fortune with his friends on the street while he considers what becoming a chef might mean for his future with the lovely Francesca. When rumors begin to circulate about a mysterious book, all of Venice searches for it, in the hope of claiming one of several large rewards. Many will kill for what they think is in the book; others will gladly give their lives to protect what they know is in it - and Luciano finds himself having to decide where his loyalties lie.The food references were enough to bore me to sleep, seriously. I get the whole food metaphor thing, but the reader won't really see that tie for a long time - and by then, the food has been overdone and then some. It's an interesting idea, but then it's beaten to death. Newmark actually makes part of this case herself, when she has Luciano trying to create his own recipe: it's the balance of the right ingredients that makes a story great. This is a good story, but it's weighted down, at times, by the food. The language seems wrong for the times, and everyone from the wealthy men to the street tough boys speaks in a very feminine voice, which is disconcerting.The real faults in the book are factual. The author seems to have done some poor research: (1) tomatoes were not eaten in 1498 and were called ""love apples"" in America in the 1700s, not in Italy (2) pistols were invented about 1540 (3) the first mention of the Iron Maiden in actual history is 1793 (4) the fork is mentioned in the bible but the author's given the Italians credit for the creation of it circa 1498 (5) Torquemada's call to Venice is questionable since he died in 1498 at the age of 78 - making him likely either too old or too dead to be good at his job anymore (6) there is no Bridge of Sorrows but there is a Bridge of Sighs where the ""Bridge of Sorrows"" is said to be, connecting the prisons to the Doge's Palace - but it was built in 1600.I hope Newmark sticks with it and takes another shot at the genre, because she's got the story, she's just got to put the next one together a little better.

There are also gaps in dialogue and plot lines. Even font sizes can change from one paragraph to the next. Further, Doherty has not mastered the art of subtle exposition.

ACJVGDN8G386P,0312156820,,"[2, 2]","I relate quite well to much of what is described in ""Used and Rare"", being a relatively avid book collector myself. The rare and first edition book market can seem quite antithetical to other types of buying and collecting, partially because the sensibilities border on art and other high-end collectibles. Most other kinds of sellers, such as those engaged in automobiles and real estate, will bend over backwards to accomodate potential buyers. But for reasons not quite clear to me, even after 20 years of collecting, a number of rare and antiquarian booksellers project an air of aloofness and even, in some cases, downright rudeness, which seems at odds with selling goals. A few higher-end sellers, but certainly not the majority, communinicate through subtle expression, body language and tone that they are doing potential customers such a favor by having their books available for sale. Some have even expressed, not in so many words, that the buyer should be grateful to have the privilege of being able to buy these books from these sellers. Of course, the vast majority of booksellers are very nice amiable people but the few who ""put on airs"" stick out in collectors' minds like a trashed copy of a first edition. The message from a few of these sellers is quite simple: if you don't have a lot of money, then stop wasting my time. (Of course, the downside is a seller may never know when a collector might come into a lot of money to spend on his or her hobby, and it is not in the seller's best interest to brush anyone off so easily.)The Goldstones, who simply began as a literature and book-loving couple of modest means, didn't know the strange and varied landscape of rare books habituated by an eccentric cast of sellers, some of whom could warrant a book all by themselves, or even a TV-Movie. These characters are nearly as strange and fascinating as the enticing editions they sell. Their adventures begin innocently enough when Laura Goldstone decides to buy a hardcover edition of ""War and Peace"" for her husband for Christmas which turns out to be the first step in their book collecting journey. What they encounter through their exploits is akin to a kid who collects modern baseball cards stumbling upon a Honus Wagner card.""Used and Rare"" chronicles their collecting journey from buying cheap hardcover editions of important and favorite works in inexpensive editions such as those published by the Heritage Press and the Modern Library which might only cost around $10 to important and rare editions which are locked in glass cases at bookshops. Eventually they graduate to the upper-echelons of book collecting, which includes first editions, signed copies, early states, and fine bindings. They begin asking booksellers questions about first editions, first printings, states, and scarcisty, leading them to many of the same books but in much more expensive editions, sometimes in original bindings, original dust jackets, and signed by their respective authors which can fetch $100's, $1000's and even $10,000's in the collectible marketplace.Along the way, they meet a few high-end booksellers who seem uninterested in selling books, except to high-end collectors where money is no object. One bookseller even says ""we are very careful about our advertising"", implying they don't just want ""any"" buyer, as if money from one buyer isn't the same as money from someone else. Another woman in charge of the rare and first edition book room of a bookshop in Boston is never available each time the couple arrives to see the books. On one occasion, the woman claims she is late for an appointment and about to leave, and therefore won't be able to show the couple the rare book room. On a hunch, the Goldstones browse for awhile in another section of the bookshop, and then take a peak at the woman's desk. She was still sitting there without having left for her ""appointment"". The implication seemed pretty clear: the woman didn't want to bother allowing the young couple to see the books. Would a car salesperson prevent and even discourage a potential buyer from seeing the cars?The rare book world is full of strange characters, eccentricities, and perplexing pricing. At one point the Goldstone's are flabbergasted that a first edition of ""Tarzan"" is priced in a mid-five figures, while a 17th-century edition of the works of an English poet and playwright which had been owned and written in by Herman Melville, author of ""Moby Dick"", is available for quite a bit less. Melville had taken the book with him at sea and written notes in the margins, some of which would later become part of ""Moby Dick"". How could Tarzan, a fun book but not exactly something of the caliber and importance as an artifact owned by the author of ""Moby Dick"", be priced so much higher? For the same reason that a napkin scribbled by Andy Warhol was appraised at $25,000 to $30,000. The Goldstones learn, I think, that a lot of the collectible market is not based on concrete rationality but on impulse and a very human quality of the modern era: the desire to own.A fine and honest book on a subject one rarely sees in print. Although there are many books on book collecting itself, there are very few which describe first-hand the in's and out's of navigating through the book market. And through it all, they find some of the books they want for a lot less than some other dealers' offerings for the same books. I see book collecting as a kind of treasure hunt, which is how I believe the Goldstones eventually view it. If I can have any book I want by simply shelling out a lot of money, what's the fun in that? Much more satisfying to excavate a treasure from within the earth of a cheap bookstore...",5.0,"A ""Rare"" Glimpse into the World of Bargain-Hunting for Rare Books",1289001600.0,"11 6, 2010"

A1UBBIDQTDDF79,B00004TSHU,"George Peabody ""Ariel""","[2, 2]","THIS IS A LIVE RECORDING!!!!!There is nothing more exciting than listening to a recording of a performance that is taking place at a partiular time.  The performers are definitely 'up' for it, as is the conductor.  That is one reason why I LOVE these Maulbronn records.  Oh,of course, we sometimes risk an incorrect note or two, but if the emotional investment on the part of the singers, etc. is great, then we are privy to a unique experience.In 1741, two weeks after completing 'Messiah' Handel set about the difficult task of translating Milton's dark and dense meditation on the Samson Bible story.  Milton's poem 'Samson Agonistes' is a work of Milton's late years based largely on the 16th Book of Judges in the Bible. Blind himself at this point, and thus responsive to the tormented blindness of the biblical Samson (a point not lost on Handel, whose own sight was beginning to fail), Milton created a work for the reader's eye and ear, as well.  And Handel brings all this out in his Oratorio with the agonizing song Samson sings ""Total Eclipse"", sung dramatically and well by tenor Marc LeBrocq. Several months later and several revisions later it was finally completed, but not performed until Feb. 1743, at which time it was a great success.  It retained its popularity through Handel's lifetime and has never fallen out of favor!Of George Frederick Handel of England, born Georg Friedrich of Germany, an English critic wrote,""He did bestride our musical world like a Colossus."" The English passion for oratorio is largely due to Handel. Every year from 1738 to 1751, he produced at least one which included a series of biblical subjects based on Old Testament heroes.  It would be prudent for anybody listening to this disc to read the story in the 16th book of Judges, as there is no libretto included in the accompanying booklet.  In fact, everything is in German.The two main characters are Samson (LeBrocq-tenor) and Micah (Michael Chance-countertenor).  Chance, in his role as Samson's consoler, is very convincing with his highly dramatic singing along with his rich and full tone quality. Le Brocq is properly tormented and angry and his renditions disply this well.  Sinead Pratschke, soprano, as Delilah, Samson's downfall, sings with a light, bright voice, not quite intense enough for my taste, but certainly in character.  David Thomas, bass, and Raymond Nolte, baritone fullfilled their roles skillfully.Maulbronner Kammerchor has a good crisp sound, and although not perfect, they are certainly one of the strengths of this recording.  They sing the faster pieces with a  lively bounce while still finding the right depth of tone for the darker moments. The Barockorchester provides clean and well-articulated playing.  Jurgan Budday has a good feel for the structure of Handel's music, and supports his singers well.  His tempos are steady, though a bit sluggish at times.Unlike the other biblical oratorios, which were all other reworkings of existing Scripture-based plays or original creations by Handel's  librettists, 'Samson' stands alone .  The librettist, Newburgh Hamilton, through skillful abridgements and juxtapositions of Mlton's poem managed to maintain the integrity- the sobriety and penitential tone of the original.There are some really tuneful and lively Handelian tunes in this oratorio; some of which are: ""Return O God of Hosts"" Chance and the chorus- ""How  Willing My Paternal Love"" Raimond Nolte(baritone)- ""Ye Sons of Israel, Now Lament"" Chance-and it concludes with the familiar chorus: ""Let the Celestial concerts all Unite"". This music is Handel at his greatest!On February 24, 1743, three days after the premiere of 'Samson', the politician Horace Walpole, a devotee of Italian opera, wrote to Horace Mann: ""Handel has set up an Oratorio against the Opera, and succeeds.....""",5.0,a voice teacher and early music fan,1138233600.0,"01 26, 2006"
A2XNOB1T796Y6B,0142410306,"ChibiNeko ""Sooo many books, so little time!""","[2, 2]","I'll state it up front: this book was disappointing. I'm not arguing the whole ""Hunter dies in the beginning"" point. I actually thought that made for an interesting plot element. Tiernan had started setting something to this extent up in the previous book by mentioning Colm & that ending his job as a Seeker meant that Hunter would be unguarded. It's just that this book is very poor in quality when held up against the other Sweep books. It read more like a fanfiction you'd find on the internet than something by Tiernan herself.This book finds Morgan reeling over the death of her beloved Hunter in a freak ferry accident. Years pass and Morgan has managed to heal, marry one of her fellow witches of Belwicket, as well as give birth to her daughter Moira. The story picks back up six months after the death of her husband, with Moira going through many of the same issues Morgan herself went through as a new dark force threatens their peace & whispers of secrets held for sixteen years.As a standalone book, this wasn't bad. It's readable & entertaining for the most part. However, when I compare it to the rest of the Sweep books, it frankly sucks. The previous books were all of high quality (even when I didn't like them that much), so this one was incredibly disappointing to read.The #1 failure of the book is that it runs through too many plot elements too quickly. Another reviewer stated that the book has Moira going through all of Morgan's issues in the span of a few days, which is the truth. So much happens so quickly that it's really not all that believable & very little of the plot is fleshed out enough to make any of these elements have any life of their own. Moira is pretty much a watered down version of Morgan, with little personality of her own. She's not an unlikeable character by any means, but the book goes by so quickly that very little of Moira's personality shows through. She pines after a boy, she mopes over her father's death, she anquishes over the ""is he or isn't he evil"" signs. Other characters are trotted out, but are so thinly written that you pretty much ignore them for the most part.If this had been fleshed out more & put into 2-3 books rather than one book, the story would have been far better. It's just that the book is ""this happens, oh now this happens & this happens"". The ending is frankly ridiculous when you realize how quickly everyone supposedly moves & realizes things.I liked the book enough to give it 3 stars, since Tiernan's writing ability shines through & manages to polish this lackluster entry with as much gusto as she can. I know that the publishing company had an unreasonable amount of control over the series length & plotting, so it is them that I blame for this book. At times it felt like I could really sense Tiernan's frustration over having to cram 2-3 books (600-900 pages)worth of plot into 300 pages.If you are a Sweep fan, I recommend getting it & reading it just so you can finish the series. I just recommend getting this from the library instead & sticking to just volumes 1-14 for the basic story. This book just could have been so much better, which is where this story really disappoints- you know the potential it could have had.2.9/5",3.0,"Good, but mostly disappointing",1271894400.0,"04 22, 2010"

A8CDKDFHE09MG,0743264584,B. Hartig,"[16, 17]","As the debate for marriage equality for same-sex couples moves to the ballot box in a dozen states this Fall, Evan Wolfson's thought-provoking and well-laid-out book, Why Marriage Matters, could not have appeared at a better time.Addressed to a gay, as well as non-gay, audience, Mr. Wolfson builds up a steady and powerful case for marriage equality in our country's legal system. He addresses this subject in layman's terms but without being too simple. He doesn't preach, but answers the questions (and explains his answers) that are most often on the minds of those on both sides of the fence.One of the most interesting and significant concepts Mr. Wolfson lays out and clarifies is that of marriage equality as a civil right. He explains how marriage equality parallels other civil rights issues, dissecting arguments made against marriage equality. He shows how the same arguments that have been used at various points over the past two hundred years to deny other citizens their constitutionally guaranteed civil rights continue to be used to this day to deny marriage equality.The book reads as much like a thoughtful and provocative essay for the general public as it does a primer for concerned gay and lesbian citizens interested in how marriage equality could affect their personal and legal lives. Addressing the anti-same-sex marriage constitutional amendments being voted on in several states this Fall, Mr. Wolfson shows why, after these battles are over, there will still be much to struggle for in the days beyond. Mr. Wolfson not only forecasts trends, but he prepares his audience for their realization through a series of recommendations and ideas for educating Americans and dealing with fairness issues.Having worked with various human/gay/civil rights organizations and seen how real this struggle is for the gay and lesbian community, I was impressed with the succinctness of Mr. Wolfson's arguments. He clearly outlines and explains the fairness of bringing about marriage equality in America while showing how this issue is ultimately everyone's struggle.I would suggest that you read this book if you are concerned for personal reasons about marriage equality. Or read it if you have friends, relatives or co-workers who are affected by its message. But most of all, read Why Marriage Matters if you are concerned about the fairness and equity of all of our laws to all of our people. Because it really truly boils down to the words of the Rev.

A6ILX2ZVMU6JX,0061996181,jane's_bookshelf,"[0, 0]","4 1/2 out of 5 stars.Clara Gardener has had quite the school year. First she had to move to Jackson Hole, Wyoming, a far cry from southern California, that&#8217;s for sure. Secondly the boy she was supposed to save (according to her purpose) was (socially) out of reach because, well, it is high school. Thirdly she fell in love with a boy she never expected to get along with, let along begin to care for. And last, but certainly not least, she and her mother were both almost killed by a deranged murderer, as are most murderers. Oh, yeah, and she messed up her purpose so bad that both her and Christian&#8217;s lives are pretty jacked up right now. That about sums up her time in Jackson Hole so far, and all Clara is hoping for this year is a bit of peace and quite. But becomes abundantly cleat to her that an angel&#8217;s work is never finished.Clara has always thought that she would have one great purpose and once she had completed it, she could go on living her life. But since she messed up her purpose, it seems that something else is brewing in place of that original purpose, and someone she loves is going to die, possibly because of what she did. She doesn&#8217;t know the how or why, not even who it&#8217;s going to happen to, but it is going to happen during springtime. Clara has learned from experience that purposes may look or mean one thing when, in reality, they are actually completely different from what you thought they were. Clara begins wonder if her latest dream is supposed to be a warning, a future she is meant to change, or if she is just meant to stand by and let it all happen? She took her future into her own hands once before, and look at what that got everyone! Clara doesn&#8217;t regret what she did, just the people she hurt because of that choice. But how on earth can she let thisdream come to pass, letting that person go without putting up a fight? The answer is as clear as day to her: she won&#8217;t.Can Clara stop what she&#8217;s seen, or is her entire world about to break apart? Will she ruin everything again by trying to stop the inevitable, or is she the one who can fix it all, past, present, and future?There is a commonly known illness going around and authors seem to be the only ones catching it: Second (or sophomore) Book Syndrome. It is very common, and very deadly to both the writer and their readers. The side-effects of this deadly virus are:Mediocre or runaround plot lines,Characters who seem to be bipolar and not like themselves,Half a**ed bad guys,Mind-numbingly boring filler so they can call it a book and not a novella,And the infernal love triangle that makes the average reader despise both the heroine and/or the heroe(s).Most authors I have read have been victims to Second Book Syndrome, but I am very glad to say that Cynthia Hand's &#34;Hallowed&#34; was not one of them, and that is why I bought all three of her books online right after finished them. Yes, I loved them THAT much.  Paid through the nose, too, but I regret nothing!Alright, let&#8217;s start talking about the premise of this book, and all the reasons why I love it and its author.Clara knows that someone she loves very much is going to die, and she estimates that it is springtime when she will have to say goodbye to them. The only problem with this (besides that person dying, of course) is that she has no clue who it will be. Clara (beware) kind of goes a bit skit-so because she doesn't know if she can stop it from happening, and she doesn't know who to protect from it, and actions are quite understandable, although at times are a bit too stalkerish for comfort. We all have experienced loss of a loved one at one time or another, and so I wasn&#8217;t too bothered by her manic depressant attitude because I could empathize with her, but there were times when she was very selfish and did not recognizing it as being so, and that did bother me a bit. She hurt a lot of people in &#8220;Hallowed&#8221; because of her oblivious, self-centered nature, but she did learn some lessons that lead to good character growth in this book, and so that wasgood.Christian was also a great character in this book. I really began to see his sweet side and I was more willing to acknowledge that he was a good guy, whereas in &#8220;Unearthly&#8221; I was practically chanting Tucker&#8217;s name every time Christian was present. To be quite honest, I was still chanting Tucker&#8217;s name the entire book, but I could admire Christian for his kindness towards Clara during a tough time in her life and the friendship he offered her. The only thing I didn&#8217;t like was that Clara was still undecided when it came to her and Christian even though she was dating Tucker.  That&#8217;s a no, no in my book, but I can forgive Cynthia because I got why Clara was torn whereas in most books there's usually no reason to be indecisive. I didn't like it, but I can respect it.TUCKER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Yeah, I have fallen in love with this boy, and I am still wondering why God hasn&#8217;t created any boys like my Tucker, and if He has, where are they in this universe?!! I had read this series while the Olympics were going, and every time I saw someone skiing or snowboarding, I started to cry because I was thinking of all of Tucker&#8217;s and Clara&#8217;s beautiful times together! Okay, I wasn&#8217;t crying, but I did go into fangirl mode in front of my sisters a few time. I'm kind of crazy/nerdy in fangirl mode if you haven't already noticed.Besides the fact that I love this boy, Tucker is just a fantastically written male character.  He was smart, funny, and sweet while still being a really strong male lead. He was practically the only full-blooded human in Clara&#8217;s group, but he held his own in &#34;Hallowed&#34; and didn&#8217;t act like a weakling even when Clara kicks him in the emotional&#8230;well, I'll leave that for you to fill in if you would like. There are just so many layers to his character despite the fact that he was the good boy in this series. He wasn&#8217;t mysterious or broody, and maybe that was/is the reason why I loved his character so much.I happen to hate it when authors think that, for a character to be interesting, they need to make them broody and mysterious or misunderstood. That&#8217;s great for some people, but that is exactly what I dislike in male characters. I feel that the characters play too many games (never communicating is one of the worst products of these games) romantically if they are written that way; playing games in relationships, romantic or not, never ends well. Honesty is the best policy. I get that authors try to build tension or intrigue through those personality traits, but it doesn&#8217;t always work out well, and then the writers dig themselves into, not just holes, but trenches that are nearly impossible to climb out of when the time comes. Cynthia Hand, however, created tension between friends and family, romantic drama, and emotional turmoil without too many of those irritating games being played (Christian and Clara had some of those kinds of moments, althoughthe fault lies with Clara 99% of the time. And Tucker, my love, was never the issue, even when Clara did something stupid. YAY!). Yeah, maybe there were some of those games in this book, but Cynthia did a great job of writing them so that I wasn't irritated with her or the characters.P.S. Tucker is such a good quality character that he doesn&#8217;t need all of that drama to become a dynamic, intriguing, and unforgettable character. He is a BOSS and he has his own SWAG to go with it.Character drama aside, there are a lot of things going on in this book. The bad guy from the first book comes back and he isn&#8217;t who I originally thought he was; oh, he&#8217;s still as evil as they come, but there is more to him than meets the eye. I was also a little surprised by what Clara discovers about herself, and maybe I should&#8217;ve guessed it, but I didn&#8217;t because maybe, just maybe, I am extremely gullible. Then we find out who is going to die in this book, and I kind of cried, like a lot. Like a faucet, actually.Those tears didn't stop until a few minutes after I finished &#34;Hallowed&#34;; the last scene in this book was super emotional in a sad but happy way. I have to hand it to Cynthia Hand, she really got the waterworks going, and that takes a skilled writer to do that to me. Tahereh Mafi, although I loved her first two books and her novellas, she never made me cry. I think that is one of the signs of my favorite author(s) is whether they can make me cry or laugh alongside their characters. Cynthia Hand made me laugh, cry, and dance around my room in happiness, and I cannot wait to read more of her books. AMAZING!!!P.S. The only thing that I didn&#8217;t like about this book was Clara&#8217;s friend, Angela. I really wish Wendy, Tucker's super awesome twin sister, had been the main female friend, but other than that I really liked this book. check-out by blog:  booksandwonderfulthings.wordpress.com",5.0,Cynthia Hand does it again!!!

AT1QB5ANO0ARR,1595143068,M. Hamilton,"[0, 0]","I absolutely loved this series.  I have waited for each book to come out and read them within a couple days every time.  This story wrapped up like I thought it would as far a Dimitri and Rose go.  It was suspenseful, they were a team again and they involved Sonya and her lover (can't remember his name right now).  There were a few things I was disappointed in though:1. I didn't feel like Rose and Dimitri ever really talked about what happened.  It seemed more avoided.  I would have liked a real heartfelt discussion to happen between them.  One that would give them that magnetic energy you always felt between them.2. I felt like Dimitri's family should have been addressed or brought into the book somehow.  I loved the time she spent with the family and re relationship with them.  I would have liked it if they had gone there, talked to them or if they would have visited...even at the end of the book during the ceremony.3. I would have liked more background on Rose's parents...maybe their history and what happened between them. Also more on Sydney and Abe's association.All in all it was a good book. For a final book it lacked for me, especially compared to the others.  Highly recommmended series and I plan to read the spin-off series as well.

Low has even begun to express a sense of wonder and, gasp, happiness.  Rest assured that they will still keep you company on rainy days when it's all gone wrong and even the brighter moments are tinged with melancholy.People who have difficulty with subtlety (Mogwai, whom I like, seems to have quiet moments only to make the loud moments louder...) or well-considered composition will be confused.

A1ORZKYPMHLRUC,B0046REPAO,Jancal,"[1, 1]","We recently purchased a new mattress set as well as a gel mattress topper, so I wanted to try a gel memory foam pillow to complete my experience.  After a lot of hedging with Amazon's many choices, I decided on this one by Serta partly based on reviews, and partly because Serta leads the mattress field with their gel coolness technology.  On arrival the pillow was wrapped in clear plastic printed with the bold black Serta label, there was a Serta booklet enclosed, then 2 other pamphlets saying congratulations on your Sleep Innovations gel-infused memory foam pillow purchase, and warranty info from Sleep Innovations.  SAY WHAT?  I initially thought that a Sleep Innovations pillow was mistakenly sent in a Serta bag but no, the Serta booklet explained all - inside it says:&#34;Serta by Sleep Innovations - The Ultimate in Memory Foam Innovation.  Serta, one of the world's most recognized and trusted brand names, has partnered with Sleep Innovations to bring you a complete range of premium memory foam products...&#34;  Thereafter are photos of three different memory foam pillows including this gel reversible one, and two mattress toppers.  It seems this line is made exclusively for Amazon, which is a good thing as you're getting a better quality pillow than some of the prior SI gel pillows, which could be harder & more odorous (see reviews from BJ's).  What I received is a good quality, comfy, ventilated with air holes memory foam pillow of medium firmness, cushy yet supportive, with a firmer gel side that initially was pretty hard but again, one of the pamphlets explained why:&#34;when exposed to colder climates (it is winter in NY & courier left pillow outdoors) your pillow will become firmer, allow your pillow 24-48 hrs to renew its feel once placed in room temperature.&#34;  Also, this pillow had the barest trace of memory foam smell, which went away the next day after removing cover (a nice soft quilted 100% cotton cover w/ Serta label sewn on side).  I have to say, for this reasonable price, I'm happy with my new gel foam pillow and definitely notice a cooler sleep experience, no waking up with a sweaty neck.

I have had no problems installing or running the game. For those who have, a patch and a FAQ are now available ...The most noticeable improvement of GP4 over GP3 is that the tracks are now synthesized from GPS data. The bumpiness is more evident and the elevation changes very apparent. Use of a Force Feedback wheel adds a great deal to the experience. The focus of the Force Feedback in GP4 is on providing feedback on what the car is doing. For example you won't feel the wheel vibrate over rumble strips, but you will feel the back end of the car step out if you step on the gas too hard. It's quite amazing. Be sure to switch the ""Centering Force"" of the FF wheel off, or you won't feel this kind of effect.GP4 is for people who want a racing simulation more than for gamers looking for a quick thrill.

Allen Greenbaum,"[13, 16]","&quot;Stately, plump Buck Mulligan came from the stairhead, bearing a bowl of lather on which a mirror and a razor lay crossed.&quot;  &quot;Ulysses&quot; begins with an easily understood sentence, identifiable  actions and objects, and little of the puns, ambiguities (well, except for  what word &quot;stately&quot; modifies) and symbols (ok, maybe the cross on  the bowl of lather) for which Joyce is read, and, perhaps just as often,  not read.I think it's well worth reading; in fact, it's probably my  favorite book (so far), one to which I return often.  I think the key to  enjoying--rather than just finishing--the book is that it can be read on  many levels. One can choose to decode every historical, literary, and  religious allusion, the staggering play of words, and sometimes barely  comprehensible inner dialogue.  I recommend decoding these  selectively--they do add meaning and humor--but to also read this as a kind  of tone poem, in which language itself is celebrated and elaborated, with  passages of great humor and sympathy. A non-slavish interpretation of the  book, enables one to laugh (out loud, even) at the rich humor, to identify  with the struggles of every-person Leopold Bloom, and to savor, Zen-like,  the sound soup without total comprehension.  In addition to Joyce's mastery  and subversion of the language, there are larger issues: A liberal critique  of ethnocentrism, nationalism, dogmatism, and vanity.  Criticized by some  as degrading the human spirit (see Jeffrey Segall's &quot;Joyce in  America&quot; for a very good review of critical reactions), it is really a  celebration of it, finding dignity and soul in the flaws and triumphs of  the &quot;common&quot; person.I can also recommend some books to  negotiate the complexities of the book, especially &quot;Ulysses  Annotated&quot; (by Don Gifford with Robert J. Seidman), &quot;The Ulysses  Guide&quot; (Nicholson), &quot;James Joyce: A to Z&quot; (Fargnoli and  Gillespie), and &quot;Ulysses, Portals of Discovery&quot; (McCarthy).  (All  of these available at Amazon.)  While I kept the Gifford and Seidman book  handy, and think it enhanced my appreciation of &quot;Ulysses,&quot;it is  definitely not necessary to solve every allusion and ambiguity.  In fact,  appreciation of ambiguity is just one of the book's many facets.

Trouble is, this is actually a ruse by former teammate Carl Weathers, to do some shameless weeding of gun runners south of the border, and the ""honorable mercenary"" Arnie is justifiably miffed for getting duped. More trouble is that the preceeding team of Soldiers were inexplicably wiped out and skinned by what we soon to discover is a very formidable (and not human) opponent. The action turns here into an escape movie, as Arnie and his team try to make there way to safety, and are hunted by the alien ""Predator"" of the title. The action is thick & fast, the special effects visceral, and the language more than colorful. This is a macho romp sure, but a good one - regardless of how over the top the characters are made out to be, the acting performances are spot on. Best of all is that this was a ""scary"" movie, that had you on the edge of your seat, and was gory and frightening to boot. Perhaps it is a sign of the times, that even with the advances in CGI, if this were made today, it would be a watered down version carrying a PG tag, attempting to make more money by reaching a wider audience(like this years Alien vs Predator). Maybe I'm wrong, but this is a horror film folks, should anybody under 17 be watching anyway??.

Plus a little reflective panel at the back that would function similar to a mirror.  That's more than some of the other available first albums offer.Compared with the one we received several years ago, we feel that the pages are a little more difficult to turn.  It's possible that this is just because the pages were so compressed in shipping.  Perhaps this problem will work itself out as the new little one uses it.Likewise, the outer cover seems a little more stiff and a little less soft than the previous product we had.  That's our comparison, but it may prove to be more durable as a consequence.The good news is that photos are inserted from an opening closest to the inside binding on each page.

A2RWHTNM5P3I8Y,0060014342,Sheryl Katz,"[4, 7]","""In the Wake of the Plague"" reads like a collection of lectures; my guess is that it was assembled from various essays and lectures that Cantor had written over time.Each chapter reads like and independent essay, and resultantly there is quite a bit of repetition and a lack of chronology.  The writing style is breezy.  The book can either be seen as easy to read due to the conversational prose, or hard to read due to its lack of a linear timeline and assumption of a fair amount of knowledge on the part of the reader.I enjoyed this book very much because I found it to be a provocative series of pieces from a knowledgeable author.  Many of the essays felt like counterfactual arguments - ""What if the plague had not occurred - how would it have affected women?""  ""What if the plague had not occurred - how would it have affected the legal system?""  ""What if the plague had not occurred - how would it have affected _____(fill in the blank - Jews, finance, politics, scholarship, land ownership . . .)""  At times I found the analysis absurdly reductionist as in the discussions of land ownership, law or scholarship.  At other times I found the analysis to be so provocative as to be embarassed for the author, as in the discussion of the possibility of the plague being started by something from outer space.  Overall I felt as though (I too bought it in the airport) I were being accompanied on the plane flight by a gifted raconteur with great knowledge and fascinating ideas who at times bordered on the edge of being a crackpot.I enjoyed it.  If you are interested in the middle ages, the interplay between biology and history, or just love to read good essays, I think you will too.

A912QKZ7UYI8L,0434014125,"Chris Gladis ""Chris""","[4, 4]","Imagine a world where magic is real. A place where people known as Others are born with powers they don't understand.  Their destinies are unwritten until that fateful day when they first become an Other - when they discover the strange, shadowy and powerful world known as the Twilight - and have to make a choice: will they stand with the Light or with the Dark.  Will they dedicate their lives to Good or Evil?It's not an easy decision to make, by any means.  Joining either side has its limitations and its rules, for the battle between Good and Evil isn't what it used to be.Long ago, it was simple - Good fought Evil, Dark fought Light, and blood was shed on both sides.  It was a vicious, unending war that threatened to decimate the world.  Finally, the two sides reached an agreement.  A Treaty, well deserving of the capital letter.  There would be a truce between the two sides, a balance that would be maintained at all costs.  Any act of evil would be balanced by an act of goodness, and vice versa.  Neither side is to have an advantage.Making sure the peace is kept is the job of the Watches - the Night Watch, staffed by elites of the Light to guard against advances by the Dark, and a Day Watch, staffed by the elites of the Dark to guard against excesses of the Light.  We begin our look at the Others of Moscow with a young adept named Anton Sergeeivich Gorodetsky, a wielder of magic and an analyst forced into the more exciting realm of field work.  His job is to find out who a pair of vampires are illegally attempting to seduce and stop them.  In the process of doing that, and saving the soul of a young Other named Egor, he stumbles upon something that threatens the entire city of Moscow, if not all of Russia.  A young woman has a curse upon her head, so horrible and so powerful that the forces of the Light may have no chance to disperse it.  If she dies, the city will die with her.  If she lives, even worse may befall the world.There are three stories in this book, somewhat independent but entirely connected.  The first details the discovery of Egor and the cursed Svetlana.  In the second, an Other of the Light, a maverick who doesn't know about the rest of the Others, or the Treaty between Light and Dark, is murdering Dark adepts.  Somewhat alarmingly, Anton is being framed for the murders.  In the third book, Moscow is gripped in a heat wave.  In the midst of this, the leaders of the Light are attempting to change the world.  Whether it ends up being for the better or the worse, no one can know.  But Anton is convinced that it must not come to pass....It's a gripping fantasy, in a very complex world.  It's compared to Rowling's work, and justly so (although I don't think there's much of a case to be made for an attempt to ride on Rowling's coattails - Night Watch was originally published in 1998, only a year after the release of Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone).  There are substantial differences, of course, making Night Watch a much more adult book than the Potter series.  There are very few children, and the few that are there are not in very substantial roles.  There's far more drinking, smoking and sex in this, of course.  But the world that Lukyanenko has created is every bit as deep and complex as the one Rowling has made.  There are any number of roles that could be played, and an almost infinite number of situations that could be built on the fairly simple rules that are set up by the Light-Dark Treaty.The biggest difference, of course, is in the complexity of the world.  Rowling's world is fairly definitive in its divisions between good and evil - there is good, there is evil, and there is no question of which is which.  The evil characters are definitively evil, and the good characters are definitively good, and the reader doesn't have to worry too much about who's on which side, Snape notwithstanding.The Others of Moscow, however, are not nearly so clear-cut.  Yes, the Light is trying to do the work of the Good, to make the world a better place.  But their machinations and their plots don't always go as planned.  See the Russian Revolution and World War II for examples why.  They ignore the Law of Unintended Consequences and the horrors it can unleash.  By trying to do Good, they unleash great evil upon the world.And how about the Dark?  Yes, they're populated by werewolves, witches and vampires, but they are advocates of utter and total freedom.  They do not destroy for the sheer joy of destruction, but because they want to increase the personal freedom of the world.  They're not interested in making humanity ""better,"" or making a better world.  They simply want to live in the world as it is, free from restraints - both internal and external.While it may be pretty clear who is on the Light and Dark side, it's not entirely clear who is doing Good or Evil at any given time.  And, more importantly, it is almost impossible to know who is actually right.It's a great read - full of anguish and self-doubt and torture, like any good Russian novel should be.  Anton knows that the Light doesn't live up to the standards that it preaches, but he knows that he needs to be on the right side.  He picks apart the intricate, decades-long plot of the Night Watch and very nearly figures out how to foil it.  But even in revealing the truth, he does not manage to save the world from the doom of the Light.Or does he?We'll have to read the next book and find out....",4.0,This review has been approved by the Light and the Dark,1232582400.0,"01 22, 2009"

A3NGCA38Q3GP9N,B008TQJMCY,michelle,"[9, 10]","Several years ago I moved into an over 55 apartment complex in Tacoma, WA.  3 months later I began to have bug problems, which escalated into a full blown infestation. I Called exterminators(who at that time only dealt w/fleas indoors), entomologists, talked to management, used repeated bug bombs, sprays...you name it, I tried it.  I really liked the apartment(very pet & people friendly and beautiful grounds).  I finally went online to see what the 4 star hotels in New York were using and found the company, VISION BAY/ (ELF BRANDS), who was distributing an enzyme cleaner that killed bedbugs, mites, lice etc. AND THEIR EGGS!!  They listened to me, advised me and knew exactly what I was talking about.  The product they sent me worked without my pets and I having to leave the apt. for several days and didn't have the lingering insecticide residue.  I noticed, however, that the product I purchased needed to be less diluted and was requiring stronger concentrations to be effective. It also didn't seem to work well in the laundry.HERE'S WHAT MAKES AN EXCEPTIONAL PRODUCT!! The company was often and w/every order asking me how I liked the product, how I used it, WAS THERE ANYTHING I DIDN'T LIKE ABOUT IT OR WOULD LIKE TO SEE CHANGED?  Most importantly, they were candid and honest w/me and told me a number of other customers had my same concerns and they were attempting to create a new version with a stronger enzyme formula.  Hence, the creation of Nature's Eradicator, which was in fact much stronger and more effective.  After using NE(Nature's Eradicator), I was very pleased with how it performed, especially in my laundry and clothing, and it was seriously strong.  Once again, Vision Bay wanted and actively requested feedback on the product.  I noticed it left a sticky residue.  The creator's of NE said they were getting feedback from other customers regarding the stickiness and also a slight vinegar smell and were changing the formula to reduce those, while still keeping the enzymes at the same level.They made those changes, primarily because of customer feedback, and have what I consider to be one of the best bug control, cleaning and natural products on the market.SERIOUSLY, when was the last time a company asked for your feedback and listened to it, then changed their product accordingly.  I'm not talking about the automated customer satisfaction survey's or calling you to make sure you are happy with the product and, oh, by the way, did you know for this much more a month you can have...  I'm talking about people who want to know you are happy with the product and are willing to solicit advise on how to improve it.  A truly good company is usually the reason for a truly good product.  Nature's Eradicator is the result and superior to the many products I've tried.",5.0,Nature's Eradicator: The best and safest pest control/elimination on the market,1379894400.0,"09 23, 2013"

A3VIS19QJDY8YD,0199539960,Steven Davis,"[1, 1]","The Lusiads is Portugal's national epic. It is a poem depicting the voyage of Vasco da Gama around Africa to India in 1497-98. The author, Luis Vaz de Camoes, made similar journeys as a common sailor barely fifty years later, writing The Lusiads as he went. He first published his poem in 1572, but evidently to no great acclaim as Camoes died in poverty a few years later.The Lusiads is not only a national epic, but a very nationalistic one. It manages to recount, in glowing terms, all of Portugal's history from Roman times to Camoes's present (using prophesy to relate what was to come after de Gama's voyages). We learn, for example, that one Portuguese warrior is worth at least a dozen Spaniards. Camoes models his work after Odyssey and the Aeneid. The poet's stated purpose is to show that Portugal is a greater empire than Rome, that da Gama was a greater voyager than Odysseus or Aeneas, and (by inference) that Camoes is at least as great a poet as Homer or Virgil. The work suffers from his excess of ambition, and the author's occasional petulant outbursts (italicized in my edition) about his lack of financial success don't help at all.One of the oddities of the Lusiads is that the classical Roman gods and demigods are major players in what is presented as an epic struggle between Christianity and Islam. Venus is da Gama's special protectoress, while Bacchus sides with the Mohammedans and tries to sabotage the expedition. Camoes thereby makes it all the more obvious that he is donning the mantle of Homer and Virgil. (Nor does he fail to spice up the story with lots of pagan sex.) He is at pains, however, to point out in the poem itself (lest the Inquisition take offense) that he is using the gods of antiquity just as allegories for the forces of nature. Nonetheless, it is rather unsettling to have Vasco da Gama pray humbly to the Christian God for deliverance from a storm, only to have Venus come to his rescue in the next stanza by having her nymphs seduce the minions of Neptune.Da Gama was the first European to make contact with parts of Africa and Asia. Camoes followed him a few decades later to the same or similar locations. It would be marvelous if he had given us a portrait of these lands and their peoples in the manner of Marco Polo. Unfortunately, he does not, as his focus is on selling the idea of Portugal as Christianity's standard-bearer in the battle against Islam. Still we do see that there were cities and cultures of some substance, not only in India, but also along the east coast of Africa.The edition of the Lusiads I read is the translation in partially rhymed free verse by Landeg White published by Oxford World's Classics. It is both beautifully rendered and highly readable with excellent supporting material. The Lusiads is no Odyssey or Aeneid, but it is a relatively short and entertaining epic that tells us a bit about Portuguese history and a lot about a poet and a nation trying to live up to the Roman legacy.",4.0,A nationalistic epic beautifully told,1396742400.0,"04 6, 2014"

The strap goes out of place everytime and the hold for that is even breaking. There is not one thing on this bag that will not break. Even the velcro is about to fall off. Overall this bag is a rip-off, not even pleather is as bad as this. So just a warning before you buy this is to look forward to it breaking (ripping) everywhere. It is also smaller than you would imagine. The point of a bag is to be able to carry anything without it breaking if it can't then what's its purpose? To be honest the picture looks better than the actual bag.",1.0,"This bag is a ""rip""-off",1374624000.0,"07 24, 2013"

Fairbank ""MB""","[5, 5]","With his film Father, Hungarian film titan Istvan Szabo created a watershed film about the coming of age of a boy who lost his father while still a small child, and who, as he grows up, fills the void left by his father's premature death by reconstructing who the man was in his imagination.The movie has a two-part structure, the first focusing on the boy while still in grade school, the second part showing him as a young man. The latter part is played by Hungarian film and theater legend Andr&aacute;s B&aacute;lint, who is perfect in the role.Father touches on many facets of Hungarian life and culture during the communist era, but offers no harsh editorials and doesn't allow the story to veer far from the perspective of a young man looking for the truth about where he came from. The film is emotional and tinged with sentimentality without being mawkish, and showcases Szabo's unique brand of neo-New Wave storytelling at its best.",5.0,Must-See Gem of European Cinema,1173744000.0,"03 13, 2007"

Great in the sun, light on your hip, battery lasted all 4 rounds and accurate. In comparison to the G5, its better than the G5 in the sun, the graphics are more detailed, & its WAY smaller.If I had to say something I didnt like, I would say it takes some time before it finds that satellites (turn it on 10-15 minutes before your round starts) The screen can sometimes be a little sensitive...but its not the end of the world especially for what you get in return. The belt clip the GPS attaches to, doesn't come out easily at all. Which is a good thing considering you dont want the $300 you spent on the unit to fall off your hip and its so light you wouldnt feel it missing until its to late. So if you play with it on your hip rather than leaving it in the cart, you just have to pull the whole thing off your belt rather than unclipping it. But it does pull off your belt easily, so its not a big deal.I would only suggest to get a screen protector, I put 1 on mine and it works fine.

We live in an old house that was built in the 1920's so we have very thin windows and some of the doors have gaps all the way around to let air pour in or out. We are little by little replacing them all but in the meantime our living room is like an ice box in the winter. I searched and searched for some type of space heater that seemed safe enough to use around toddlers and other children but that would still look nice as well, since it would be in the area of the house that most guests hang out. Well! This Lifesmart Heater fit the bill! I will admit I was a little nervous about purchasing what would be ""a piece of functional furniture"" for my living online but since the price was unbeatable (I purchased with a coupon code) and the unit looked nice enough, I thought ""why not?"" I am so glad I did! It comes with 2 remotes, which is perfect for a house with lots of kids ( they are always losing remotes) and very convenient when snuggling up watching a good movie so we don't have to un-snuggle to adjust the temp :-)We also love the fact that you can run the ""fireplace"" without it actually putting out the heat and when the heat is on the surface is cool to the touch:) Safe for little hands and feet:)The grate where the heat comes out does get pretty darn hot but not enough to actually cause burns. Another nice feature are the wheels. They make it easy to move around the room. It's pretty heavy so I'd hate to have to pick it up in order to move it...  The hidden control panel is very straight forward so simple to use. Even my 6 yr old can operate it if he needs to! I unplug it when we are not using it just to be on the safe side but I honestly don't think it's needed. I'm just paranoid when it comes to fire and my kids... As for longevity...

A1R61P4LTACW7J,B0000DD7LB,Melissa,"[11, 17]","I was never a Britney fan from the beginning. I dont own any of her past CDs. I heard her song ""(I Got That) Boom Boom"" I really liked it. So I decided to buy the CD. Big Big mistake. I should've downloaded it but I just couldnt do it. Here's my review song by song.Me Against the Music: It's an okay song. The only reason it did okay is because it had Madonna (not too much of a fan of hers either) on it and because of the hype ""the kiss"" received.(I Got That)Boom Boom: I like the beat of this song. For me this is the best song on the album. I could have done with out the Ying Yang Twins. I guess she added them to appeal to the urban market. Sorry Britney but no matter how many urban stars you have on your record you'll never cross over.Showdown: The lyrics? You call those lyrics? I can't even follow them. I really dont know how to describe this song. I can sit here and listen to it but the song just disappears. Nothing interesting about it at all.Breathe On Me: I'd like to see her sing this one live. Yeah right. I guess I should have sad mimed this one. This song sounds familiar. Maybe its the part where she says ""this goes way beyond the physical."" Hopefully she'll go the way of Olivia Newton John.Early Mornin': Is that her voice in this song. To many machines.Toxic: This song is okay. The only part of this song I like is the part where she (the machine) says something like ""a guy like you should wear a warning."" I hear alittle bit of the Boom Boom in this one.Outrageous: This song is just hilarious. It just shows how immature she still is. Yes, R.Kelly wrote this song. But if Britney was all about the quality of music she would not have allowed this song on her CD. ""Locking down the industry"" yeah it's because of people like her the door is shut on truly talented artists.Touch of My Hand: More machines. The lyrics could have been better. Oh I wonder why she didnt include lyrics in the booklet. Moms and Dads out there maybe.The Hookup: Britney signing reggae? So funny. Sing this live Britney. Britney tries to be ""down"" on this song. It's not working. Maybe if she could actually sing without digital enhancements.Shadow: Take a lot if writing and singing lessons Britney. Not even the machines help her voice here.Brave New Girl: Dumb Lyrics. The beat reminds me of a Madonna song. Is she trying to rap? Whats with the sound effects. This song sounds like a Hillary Duff song. This belongs on the Disney channel. So much for growth.Everytime: Pretty much the only full on ballad. Again the machines dont help her voice much. Did anybody see her try to sing this song on SNL? Trully dreadful.ITS SAD THAT PEOPLE LIKE BRITNEY OVERSHADOW THE PEOPLE OUT THERE WITH ACTUAL TALENT. I ALSO FIND IT FUNNY THAT I HAVENT SEEN TOO MUCH CRITICISM THAT HER ALBUM IS TOO SEXUAL LIKE THERE WAS FOR CHRISTINA AGUILERA. THIS ALBUM IS FAR MORE SEXUAL THAN STRIPPED. AT LEAST CHRISTINA HAS THE TALENT TO BACK UP HER MUSIC. SHE CHOSE TO BE SEXUAL BECAUSE SHE WANTED TO NOT BECAUSE SHE HAD TO TO SELL RECORDS.

A2ZZXL1RTZ3VZF,B0001ZX0OC,"""ecummins86""","[5, 10]","For a while I was worried I would never get a chance to see this movie in theatre's after hearing nothing but great stuff about it from family and friends. Then because the film was up for Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor and Best Supporting Actor to name a few, the AFI Silver Theatre in my hometown of Silver Spring, Maryland began showcasing some of Penn's early and more recent films (21 Grams was one of those films as well). Mystic River was one of these selected Penn films that were being shown and when I finally saw it I was very awe-struck and amazed that it was even better than I had heard. I found Mystic River to be an ""artistic"" film just like Lost In Translation. However, the difference here is that with Lost In Translation, I couldn't see what was so great about a film that in all honesty was too slow-paced and capable of putting me to sleep throughout it as well as Murray's performance in it. So when Penn won Best Actor instead of Murray I was very pleased.It's hard to pick out certain captivating performances since every single performace was worthy and equal in every way. Penn's performance like always was thoroughly gripping and gut wrenching, especially the scene with him being held down by a mob/crowd of Boston cops when he finds his daughter dead that TV spots and trailers gave most nods and kudos towards. Tim Robbins gives an equally captivating performance as the life-long, but estranged friend of Penn and Bacon who you truly don't know whether or not if he is responsible for the death of Penn's daughter - personally I felt the whole way through that he wasn't the killer, but I was wondering throughout the whole thing if it wasn't him then who else could it have been. Bacon's performance is also captivating as the detective assigned to Penn's case and torn between the loyalty he still has to his Robbins and doing his job to find the killer of Penn's daughter. Marcia Gay-Harding as the wife of Robbins is perfect as she gradually shifts from loving wife to finding herself scared of her husband for what she thinks he may have done to Penn's daughter. Fishburne's performance as Bacon's partner was so-so. The only performance I wasn't too fond of was Linney's character. Like others who told me about the movie she was a cold person, but the fact that she lacked being in a lot of scene's took away from her character's over all demeanor.I have yet to see Unforgiven, but Clint Eastwood has definitely made his place in filmmaking history by directing two movies that have both been up for Best Picture and Best Director nominations even if Mystic River lost. Eastwood keeps you on the edge of your seat throughout the whole movie and the ending sequence when you find out who really killed Penn's daughter - don't worry I'm not giving it away for those who read this and haven't seen the movie - is shot breathtakingly well. He forces you to think throughout the entire film and then slowly fits in the remaining pieces of the puzzle for you towards the end to allow you to confirm or deny if what you were thinking about the murder of Penn's daughter was true or not. The fact that Eastwood composed the score for the film made the movie even better. I ended up leaving the theatre pondering over anything I could think of from this well crafted film. Definitely worth renting or buying (for those who have seen it in theatre's) once it's out on VHS and DVD.",5.0,A Masterpiece from both director and cast,1080259200.0,"03 26, 2004"

A2HX7FSLJ9UWH0,083081258X,"Tim R. Dolan ""Wordstudy""","[12, 13]","The book is easily organized into four parts: the introduction, the Old Testament, the New Testament, and the conclusion.  Bruce's book concludes with two appendixes, and also includes an extensive bibliography and index arranged alphabetically.Although, the main body of the book is divided into the Old and New Testaments, it is further subdivided into the history concerning each of those areas of Scripture.  For example, the very first topic concerning the Old Testament canon describes Jesus' appeal to the Hebrew Scriptures (a very early scriptural support), and the author ends the section describing what order the books were collected during the 17th and 18th century.  He also expounds upon how the apocrypha was either added to or taken away from the canon.  In order to describe the canon and how it was compiled in history, the author uses a historical chronology.  He asks such questions as: How did the biblical characters and the books themselves shed light on their contents and importance?  Did Josephus, a Jewish historian, mention the contents and was the ""classification of the books"" his own (33)?  Because of the great length of history that comprises the Old Testament, the question is asked, ""Was the canon developed in three stages?"" .... which are ""corresponding to the three divisions of the Hebrew Bible (36).""  He also mentions the so-called `Dead Sea Scrolls,' which represent all of the Hebrew Scriptures, except the book of Esther. The writer always indicates that differences of opinion existed between groups.  For instance, the Sadducees may not agree with the Pharisees in acknowledging Daniel's ""most explicit statement of the resurrection hope in the whole of the Old Testament (41)."" But, when ""we think of Jesus and his Palestinian apostles,....we may be confident that they agreed with contemporary leaders in Israel about the contents of the canon. .... when in debate with Jewish theologians Jesus and the apostles appealed to `the scriptures', they appealed to an authority which was equally acknowledged by their opponents. .... it is probable that, when the canon was `closed' in due course by competent authority, this simply meant that official recognition was given to the situation already obtaining in the practice of the worshipping community (41-42)"".  So in clarification of these comments by the author, there has always been a body of collected writings that had authority.  After writing about the particular aspects related to the original Hebrew writings, the author discusses how the Greek Old Testament arose, the order of the books, thoughts concerning its translation, and how it was used in the church.  The author stated that ""the Jews of Alexandria gave up using the language their ancestors had spoken in Palestine and spoke Greek only (43)"".  So, my first question was whether or not Jesus actually used the Hebrew Scriptures, or was he using a Greek translation?  I then discovered that when Jesus read the scroll of the Isaiah in the temple, which is recorded in the Book of Luke (4:17), that ""it was most probably a Hebrew scroll that he received.  But even in Palestine, and not the least in Jerusalem itself, there were many Greek-speaking Jews, Hellenists, and there were synagogues where they might go to hear the scriptures read and prayers recited in Greek (49)"".  The author also discusses some differences in Hebrew and Greek translations, and even later discusses in detail, how different personalities in church history viewed the two translations.  For instance, Justin Martyr ""evidently regards the Septuagint version as the only reliable text .... as read and interpreted by the Jews, the Jews (he says) have corrupted the text so as to obscure the scriptures' plain prophetic testimony to Jesus as the Christ (70)"".  The author writes further how the Old Testament is fulfilled in its witness to Jesus and how the New Testament supports the authority the Old.... although they were not yet known specifically as Old and New Testament.  He states, ""Jesus is the central subject of the Old Testament revelation; it is to him that witness is borne throughout (60)"".  Concerning the Old Testament canon, Bruce finally makes three geographical and historical distinctions; the Eastern Church, the Western Church, and the Reformed Church. He begins the discussion of the early church with the uncial codices Sinaiticus, Vaticanus, and Alexandrinus; and then continues with a description of the early fathers Justin Martyr, Melito, Origen, and Athanasius.  In the West, the largest discussion involves the translation of the scripture into Latin.  This was helpful in my later study of the Council of Nicea, that some of the attendees had disagreement or further discussed issues because of words being in both Latin and Greek.  The Latin, in this case, did not have an all-encompassing word for the two Greek words being discussed: homoousios (being) and hypostasis (substance).  Anyway, until ""Jerome produced a new translation of the Old Testament from the Hebrew text at the end of the fourth century, the Latin Old Testament was a rendering of the Septuagint, .... (83)"".  The author also mentions Tertullian and Jerome leading up to the Reformation.  In the discussion of the Reformation period he mentions, the impetus of `sola scriptura' or scripture alone.  He also mentions the Council of Trent, the Elizabethan Settlement, and different compilations of the scripture.The section concerning the New Testament begins with a discussion about early evidence and confession of the canon.  There is an emphasis on the Gospels and Pauline corpus being accepted rather quickly, and Acts following closely behind to make a connection between the two bodies of scripture.  ""The gospel collection was authoritative because it preserved the words of Jesus, .... the church knew no higher authority. The Pauline collection was authoritative because it preserved the teaching of one whose authority as the apostle of Jesus Christ of the Gentiles was acknowledged .... The bringing together of these two collections into something approximating the New Testament as we know it was facilitated by another document which linked the one to the other.  This document was Acts of the Apostles .... (132-133).""  The author talks about the movements led by Marcion and Valentinus before discussing the Catholic response concerning these heresies, and consequently, what should be included in the canon.  At this point in the book, the writer mentions the Muratorian Fragment, which appears to come from the end of the second century.  In discussing the fragment, mention is made of the authority concerning the compiling of this canon list.  Concerning the book of Luke, Bruce says, ""based on eyewitness testimony and on his own participation in the course of the events which he narrates (Luke 1:1-4). The patristic idea that his gospel owes something to the apostolic authority of Paul is quite unfounded (266-267).""  This point is interesting because of a discussion concerning apostolic authority. The Muratorian Fragment lists ""Acts as `the Acts of all the apostles'. .... What was the reason for the Muratorian exaggeration?  Possibly it marks a reaction against Marcion: Marcion claimed that Paul was the only faithful apostle of Jesus, but the compiler of our list implies, in accordance with the judgment of the catholic church, `We acknowledge all the apostles, and not Paul only; here is an authoritative document, which records their acts and not only Paul's (162-163).""  ""The apostolic authorship of Matthew and John was well-established in tradition.  But what of Mark and Luke?  Their authorship was also well-established in tradition, but it was felt desirable to buttress the authority of tradition with arguments which gave those two Gospels a measure of apostolic validation (257).""  The book makes clear that the disagreements between the church and various heretical movements led to a discussion of what should be included in the canon.  The Muratorian list also mentioned two letters which were said to be Marcionite forgeries (166).  Even another development was the leader Montanus, ""who launched a new charismatic movement. .... he claimed that the age of the Paraclete, foretold by Jesus, had now arrived, and that he was the mouthpiece of the Paraclete. .... their utterances presented a challenge to the catholic view of the faith as something `once for all delivered' (Jude 3) (168).""  A large number of personalities are listed in the main body of the book, along with the details of what they considered to be issues surrounding the canon.  The list contains Irenaeus, Hippolytus, Novatian, Tertullian, Cyprian, Clement, Origen, Dionysius, Eusebius, Constantine, Athanasius, Chrysotom, Jerome, and many others.  There is a chapter on Augustine and a large section on Luther, which further discusses Tyndale's New Testament, Calvin, the Thirty-Nine Articles, and the Westminster Confession of Faith. Before continuing into the concluding chapters of the book, there is a section entitled, ""a fixed canon.""  The statement is made, ""the New Testament consists of the twenty-seven books which have been recognized as belonging to it since the fourth century is not a value judgment; it is a statement of fact (250).""The introduction and closing sections bring all of the historical information written in the body of the book together by explaining the importance of the canon, not only for modern scholarship, but for the believer.  Bruce admits in the closing, that the theological aspect of canonization was not the subject of the book, but rather historical aspects (281).  But, this does not prevent the author from discussing such topics as inspiration.  ""In the fulfillment of Jesus' promise that the Spirit would be the disciples' teacher and bring his own words (with their significance) to their remembrance, the scriptures have been, and continue to be, one of the chief instruments, which the Spirit uses (281)"".  The closing sections also mention apostolic authority, antiquity, orthodoxy, tradition, and other issues.  The author spends a good deal of time dealing with canonical criticism .... concerning which text is canonical; and also, which criteria are acceptable for determining canonicity today.  Some scholars want to argue, ""that those who accept the traditional canon of scripture today cannot legitimately defend it with arguments which played no part in its formation (275).""  He also makes the point that those who are ""interested in the Bible chiefly as historians of religious literature have naturally little use for the concept of a canon.  Old Testament apocrypha and pseudepigrapha are as relevant to their studies as the contents of the Hebrew Bible; for them, there is no distinction in principle between the New Testament writings and other early Christian literature from (say) Clement of Rome to Clement of Alexandria.  But for theologians and indeed for members of Christian churches in general, the principle of the canon is one of abiding importance (276).""  I found Bruce's comment especially ironic and extremely factual, predominantly because of what Clement of Alexandria wrote on using the scriptures in response to heresy.  I recently have been reading some of his material.  Clement said, ""we overturn their teachings by clearly showing that their doctrines contradict the scriptures.""  Overall, I found Bruce's book to be extremely detailed historically, highly informative, and furthermore, even interesting for the average Bible student.  This book can surely also be used as a reference work because of its historical detail.  For many of the personalities that I mentioned above, he goes into much detail about what they considered to be the canon, so historically accurate that he lists the books to be included for each.

I'm a casual fan of the newspaper comic so one day I decided to catch an episode on youtube since I noticed the whole show could be picked up on the cheap.  I marveled at how well liked the theme song was among youtube posters.  Since then I've watched many adventures in Vol. 1 and have found it a refreshing change from many shows on my shelf.  It reminds me of buddy adventure shows like Xena and Hercules.  The animation won't win any awards but I quite like the voice work and overall design of the show from settings to the look of the characters.  I just wish they'd had more money to take the look of the show a couple of steps up.  If it looked exactly like the covers of these volumes it would certainly be a undisputed classic among TV animated programs.  The overall feel of the show is nice since I never really feel like I'm watching something meant strictly for young people.  Families can indeed enjoy this show together.  The violence is at a minimum and never overdone.  It teaches good values and I feel good after watching an episode, just like Xena and Hercules.

Despite all the pictures advertising the phone, it only appears to be big and bulky but it's the complete opposite. The phone is actually very slim & slender. I love that it comes in 3 different colors (Green, Blue, & Rose White) and probably more on the way. I picked up the green one and i love it. I originally purchased the Samsung Epix PDA phone and was so disappointed by the awful operating system and returned it right away. Finally the Samsung Propel hits the stores and it's basically a PDA smart phone without the Window Mobile operating system (Which is awful by the way). I love the Samsung Menu and UI. It's easy to use and just navigating through it is a breeze. You don't even need to look at the manual to operate this thing. The one downside to the Propel is that the screen could be a bit bigger and the colors could be a bit more vibrant. You only get 65K colors as oppose to the usual Samsung high end phones that come with 262K colors. So, that was one of the disappointments with this phone. Samsung knew this phone was strictly for the teens so i can see why the price is so cheap. Considering the friendly price is probably a big reason why you don't get the 262K colors. Another flaw is the Instant Messaging. You do get AIM & Yahoo but the buddylist is not in real time. You will only be able to see a few friends on your buddylist not all. But if you IM them they will respond even though they appear to not be signed in. The best thing about my Sidekick LX is that IM is in real time. I signed on from both devices and had about 50 friends on my buddylist appear on my SK while the Propel only had 3. As i stated before even though only 3 appear you can still IM the ones that don't appear and chat with them. Also AT&T; for some reason is so stingy with the accessories. I wish it came with an additional USB charger, free micro SD memory card, or a case. Unfortunately NONE. All you get is the cell & wall charger.

Silva ""Rick Silva""","[1, 1]","Oscar Wilde's last and best-known play is a classic comedy complete with mistaken identities, biting satire, and a fair amount of punning (including a crucial pun in the title). This is Wilde at his irreverent best as he repeatedly skewers as many aspects of late 19th Century English society as he can manage.I've occasionally heard the term ""joke density"" applied to comedy writing, and The Importance of Being Ernest certainly has that. Every character in the play is witty, and the jabs, barbs, and puns come fast and furious.The story centers on two somewhat roguish young bachelors who have both created elaborate lies to help them to cover for their mischief. At different points in the play, both gentlemen have assumed the false name of Ernest, which becomes a problem once two women become involved. Two women who are both particularly enamored with the idea of marrying someone named Ernest.The tightly plotted play has enough twists and turns to keep things interesting, and the witty dialogue never lets up.The Avon (a HarperCollins imprint) paperback edition that I read contained a short collection of critical essays, the most interesting being a (mostly negative) review by George Bernard Shaw of the original production of the play, which raises some interesting points about the nature of comedy. I found some good insights into the career of Oscar Wilde in the introduction and the other critical pieces, but those familiar with his life and work would not be missing much by skipping these ""bonus features"".The play itself was a really enjoyable work to read, and I'll keep an eye out for a chance to catch a performance of it sometime.",5.0,Classic Wit,1272412800.0,"04 28, 2010"

So since it cost me nothing, i decided to download it and give it a try.  I was transported back in time to a kinder, gentler, era where characters became family once again and stories became new and at the same time familiar.

A3FIH4JPFUIO0T,0061864501,D. R. Meredith,"[1, 1]","Everyone in the English-speaking world and probably beyond has heard of Wyatt Earp, the Clantons, and the gunfight at the O&#62;K. Corral. There have been whole forests sacrificed to provide the necessary paper for the hundreds of books and magazines that recount with varying degrees of accuracy the story of the West's most famous gunfight. Then there are the numerous films about Earp, Doc Holliday, and the Clantons. For those who love movies I would recommend TOMBSTONE, starring Kirk Russell.Not so well known, although everyone who knows the story of Wyatt Earp certainly recognizes the name of his wife--or the woman whom we assume was his legal wife. Although the writing could be more compelling, thus why I give four stars rather than five, the book is certainly a detailed account of the life of Josephine Marcus Earp., including her presence at the O.K. Corral. But a careful reading of the hundreds of books and articles about the events of that day will leave the impression that any resident of, or visitor to Tombstone, who didn't witness the gunfight were either dead or dead drunk, and thus unable to be a witness, so Josephine's presence was not unusual.For those who simply can't get enough of the Earps and the O.K. Corral, but more importantly, Wyatt's life with Josephine after the gunfight, I would recommend LADY AT THE O.K. CORRAL: THE TRUE STORY OF JOSEPHINE MARCUS EARP. It is one of few, very few books about the woman to whom Wyatt Earp was devoted for the majority of his life.

The writing is more practiced, the editing tighter (though the copyediting was nonexistent), and the characters more alive.  Dirgo is still going with a conglomerate cast rather than focusing on a single protagonist, but his characters are distinct enough to tell them apart, so it works.Special Agent John Taft of the secret National Intelligence Agency is sent to Serbia to investigate some surges on the European power grid.  Upon his arrival in Belgrade, as he checks out the security at the Nikola Tesla museum, he also checks out its curator, Nadia Slavja, and gets invited to her apartment for a night of passion.  While she sleeps, he copies her keys, but he makes a mistake that turns his advantageous one-night stand into something more.  When Nadia became suspicious of his motives, she spoke to her brother, a Serbian agent, and Taft winds up coming clean to the brother and sister and involving them in his scheme to save the world.When the NIA ties the European power surges to earthquake activity, and it looks as if it's all made possible by a device invented by Nikola Tesla, a plan is devised to root out the perpetrator.  The Americans make off with Tesla's papers, leaving a set of decoys planted with locator chips so when they are stolen they can be followed to the bad guys' lair.Meanwhile, Taft's partner, Larry Martinez, teams up with a thriller author who fills in a lot of blanks on the capabilities of the Tesla device, while the evil perpetrator, Galadin Ratzovik, plays the stock market and prods his captive scientist into finishing his work on the device to effect his grand finale.  Mid-mission, Taft gets called back to the States to work more closely with his partner and the author while the military takes over the search for the perp in Serbia.  With the clock ticking and the Netherlands releasing a Serbian war criminal to protect themselves from a demonstration of the Tesla device, Taft and his cronies finally figure out what Ratzovik's plan really is, but will they get there in time to stop it?This book began as a spy tale, following John Taft on his mission in Serbia, then deftly branched out into a full-blown, multiple-agency, across-the-globe mission with several teams following a multitude of leads, tightening their net as they go, until the conclusion explodes onto the pages.  Going back to the multi-angle, intricate format of his ""Oregon"" Files novels, Dirgo delivers a page-turning adventure.",4.0,Off and Running,1145491200.0,"04 20, 2006"

A16ALBDRKYUZ15,0312131712,Hugh Claffey,"[18, 18]","The overwhelming feeling you get when reading this book is the desperate struggle for short term survival. The background is a German city (possibly Cologne) in the firstDays and weeks after the capitulation of the German army in 1945.  Every conversation is focused on bread - not even full meals, just slices of bread.  The city is bleak and devastated, the characters are transient figures struggling, dazed and nauseous, into whatever the future may hold.  Their pasts are briefly mentioned, but the conditions in which  they find themselves allow for almost total dislocation from their past lives.The language of the book is austere, the characters are not clearly distinguishable, the colours mentioned - apart from grey destruction - are greenish and yellowish hazes. These tune in with the bilious, nausea of the characters as they continuously search for food and shelter. Throughout the story each character is portrayed as exhausted, struggling, nauseous.The novels main character has deserted the German Army in the final days of the war, and under a certain sentence of death for desertion, has assumed numerous identities as he flees.  He has, however, promised a dead comrade that  he will return a coat to his comrade's widow.  A will is discovered in the lining of the coat and this yields an subplot of intrigue and corruption.  The main character meanwhile meets and briefly lives with a dazed, tragic woman who has been psychologically damaged by the war.The novel's main impression is the exhaustion of emotion, the breakdown of society brings about a breakdown of morality and order.  Stealing and dishonesty of all kinds are part of daily life, as are small gestures of generosity.  In the broken cityscape, there is neither trust nor complete anarchy, just a meandering from one slice of bread to the next.  Towards the end of the book , the main character has established a certain routine which allows him to steal coal from trains, which gives him some power to barter.Boll's austere tale, gives us a view of the amoral aftermath of a societal dislocation. While neither describing nor moralizing, he shows us a set of normal characters and the lives they adopt to survive in the much reduced circumstances.",5.0,"Bleak, austere, unforgettable",1052092800.0,"05 5, 2003"

A198LFE13GE2R8,0061494151,Theodore J. Remington,"[4, 4]","Samara O'Shea's ""Note to Self"" doesn't provide endless writing prompts to jump start your journaling habit.  She gives the reader something more profound: insights into how journaling provides you with equipment for living.Sure, she gives a number of suggestions for possible areas to explore in a journal or diary--some that you might not have thought of, others that might have occurred to you but you dismissed as silly, juvenile, or dangerous.  But the pith of the book is the insight on how a journal can illuminate our lives.  O'Shea does this with specific examples, some from journals and diaries of famous writers, but mainly providing unexpurgated samples from her own journals throughout her life, along with reflections on how/why she wrote what she did.At first blush, this might seem like a tactic that could end up producing a book that tells you a lot about O'Shea and why she keeps a journal, but precious little about why you might do the same.  That's not the case.  For those of us who might like the idea of journaling but haven't been able to get into it, O'Shea shows us that when it comes to journaling, anything goes.  There is no right or wrong way.  Even starting and stopping, ending up with erratic entries rather than dutifully making a daily record of ones thoughts is fine and dandy. The takeaway (at least for me) is that you can use your journal in any way(s) you want.  Perhaps the only sin is to be dishonest with yourself, and O'Shea's numerous personal examples (and her willingness to share them publicly) make you feel much less self conscious about writing about anything in your own journal.  Heck, if she can write about doing drugs and cheating on her boyfriend in her journal--and then publish it!--certainly you can share your secret fantasy of dancing with the Rockettes or the slightly naughty dream you had about your son's second grade teacher with your own journal.For me, I've resisted keeping anything like a personal journal for a long time, mainly because something about it seemed . . . well . . . self-indulgent.  Obsessive, in some way that I found off-putting (for reasons I can't quite articulate).  But I came away from the book with the sense that the opposite is true: by recording one's thoughts and reflections, we get out of our heads and put our feelings out in the world.  True, it might be in pages that only we see, but by giving them a life of their own, we can interact with them in a way we can't when we just let them roll around inside our skulls.  And this interaction helps us grow and become better people, both for ourselves and for others.  That's not self-indulgent.  It's good ol' common sense.By the way, in spite of the semi-scandalous nature of some of O'Shea's entries, one pleasure of the book is that O'Shea herself comes across as a wonderfully complicated, engaging, funny, caring person.  In one excerpted entry, she is describing her relationship with God; in the next, giving a blow-by-blow breakdown of a teenage romance.  This is also a good lesson in its own right: we are complicated creatures, not just the choir boy or the juvenile delinquent, the princess or the bad girl.  Allowing us to see the proud and not-so-proud moments of her life, and showing that she accepts these all as part of herself (at least as she was at one time), O'Shea models how she uses her journal as a way of documenting her life as a work constantly in the process of becoming, not a static entity.That lesson alone is worth the cover price.",5.0,Equipment for living,1240185600.0,"04 20, 2009"

ASDCYQT0UQ1ZF,981435497X,"Danielle M. Smith ""The1stdaughter""","[2, 2]","Parents often find themselves with many more questions than they originally anticipated prior to a child's birth. There are most likely very few parents who anticipated an infant with pneumonia and fewer were probably curious about whether their child at age one would snore as loud as their grandfather. Some of these situations are obviously much more severe than others, but determining when to take action and when to wait it out can sometimes be the most difficult question. A parent's number one source of information and advice is always their child's pediatrician, but who couldn't use a ""go-to"" manual? Take a Deep Breath: Clear the Air for the Health of Your Child by Nina L. Shapiro, MD is the premier guide book for parents looking to ""clear the air"" for their little one as well as themselves.Initially I agreed to review Take a Deep Breath: Clear the Air for the Health of Your Child by Nina L. Shapiro because of our own family's struggle with breathing problems with my son. What I didn't expect was how wonderful a resource it would turn out to be. There were many points that Dr. Shapiro explains that we encountered during my son's infancy that we never considered simply because we felt he wasn't in any urgent distress. That's not to say we simply let him suffer through most of his first year, but had we known that using Afrin coupled with Saline drops could have relieved his allergy symptoms we would have jumped to use it. This isn't the only point, but now that he's older and suffers with severe allergy problems we will now be seeking out specific allergy testing that I wasn't aware was available until now. It also became clear to me that this would make an excellent gift to the parents of the new nephews we're welcoming into our family.One of the aspects of Take a Deep Breath that enjoyed the most was the wrap up at the end of each chapter. Dr. Shapiro breaks it down into summaries titled: ""The Big Picture"", ""Don't Worry"", ""Worry"" and a ""To-Do List"". These are so unbelievably helpful because, as it is with our own pediatrician, it can sometimes be difficult to get an appointment. There have been times I've ""pushed"" my way into an appointment only to discover that my daughter merely had a virus and ended up being better a day later. That's not to say the book will resolve all of a parents concerns and you'll never need to see a pediatrician again, but as a parent sometimes you just need a little bit of reassurance from an intelligent and reliable source to give you the peace of mind for the ""waiting period"".Also, I shouldn't fail to mention Nina's humor. Sometimes in medically based books it starts to read like a text book. For me personally, I don't feel the need to take a walk down college year's memory lane. Reading the sections in Take a Deep Breath were truly refreshing. Nina is not only a doctor with all the skills and education that comes with that title, but she's a human being with a wonderful sense of humor. She's obviously seen it all in her many years of practice and can find the humor in a two year old shoving a pea up her nose because it seems just like another ""pocket"" to put things in. I couldn't help cracking up through this section because I've been there. My daughter has been found numerous times with little balls of cereal in each nostril. It simply doesn't matter how watchful we are or how many times we've told her not to do it, she still loves sticking things in those tiny convenient holes. What was great though was to know the main danger rests in what she puts up there and never to joke around if she manages to stick a battery up there.Respiratory and breathing issues in children is something most parents can't avoid, but luckily Take a Deep Breath: Clear the Air for the Health of Your Child by Nina L. Shapiro, MD is the perfect go-to manual for parents looking for answers and reassurance. This is definitely a book I'd recommend to new parents as well as potential grandparents who may be spending any amount of time with young children. Nina Shapiro covers an extensive list of symptoms and issues, including CPR techniques, that sometimes may go overlooked and could easily provide not only your child with relief but yourself as well. Though our children are now almost ages three and five I still found a great deal of comfort as well as potential solutions to some of their respiratory issues that I'll be seeking out in the near future with our own pediatrician. Take a Deep Breath: Clear the Air for the Health of Your Child by Nina L. Shapiro, MD is by no means a replacement for your child's pediatrician but in a parent's life when sometimes you need to seek out answers and find comfort on your own this is the go-to book for child respiratory issues!Originally reviewed and copyrighted at my site There's A Book.",5.0,A parents go-to guide for breathing problems of all varieties.,1329523200.0,"02 18, 2012"

A29SHS5BZKN1VD,0965095916,Sulphur Fury,"[10, 18]","The Beatles were more than just a rock band.  In historical context, they were part of a huge government engineered social event which has been overseen through the years by secret societies and unknown branches of U.S. and British governments.  The engineering continues to evolve today.As John Lennon has stated, one moment they were playing all kinds of seedy bars, strip joints, and dance clubs across the UK and Europe.  A gritty covers band with an attitude and ability to play.  The next thing he knew, they were meeting the Queen of England and heads of state across the globe as they toured.  Transforming them from a heavy rock band into a cute, loveable teen sensation almost overnight was what their manager Brian Epstein did, as he promised if they did this they'd be rich beyond their dreams and be bigger than Elvis.  But it went way beyond even that as their importance ballooned into political issue and their effect on the 'youth culture'.  Heads of state took notice of their citizen's enchantment with the band.  The 'clean' image Epstein marketed got them into family rooms around the globe; where for the band was where the money they were promised was; and for Tavistock, a worldwide opportunity to capture the minds of the entire world's youth.What the Beatles got themselves into through Epstein's contracts and guidance, unbeknownst to them, was a role in the New World Order's plans to test out mass mind control.  You'll learn about England's top secret Tavistock facilities (which as predicted in the book, now monitors all communications passing in and out of England), and how it secretly helped engineer the Beatles 'invasion' of the U.S. and then the world and why.  A discussion of the Beatles' early music, and it's hypnotic &quot;12-atonal&quot; quality attempts to explain the reason their music seems to elicit senses within the brain common in many humans, especially those in a certain age group.The subject of the group's decision to use and publicize their use of LSD and cannabis marijuana as they began to move in their own direction beyond their manager's initial Beatlemania-era &quot;cute&quot; image, and into the psychedelic-rock/hard rock era, is discussed in detail.  Previously unpublished photos of the band using LSD and them performing at their last concerts appear in the book for the first time.Secret documents are exposed from FBI, CIA files.  Social engineering, the mark of the beast, Waco, black choppers, militia, mind control, the drug trade, Nazi connections, UFO and alien appearances, backwards messages.  The modern multimedia presentation of music and marketing began here.The book is not extremely organized in a comprehensible manner.  It's best to take this book a chapter at a time.  It seems the author may have crammed too much in one book that might have been meant for three since it says this is a trilogy.  However you will learn so much more than you may want to know about how the Beatles fit into the cosmic conspiracy that you'll scare yourself.  I think every major conspiracy theory is touched upon.The book seems to weave in and out in this manner, to some great stories about the Beatles on tour and behind the scenes, with previously unpublished photos.If any of this sounds slightly interesting, believe me, it is quite fascinating, and you should read this book immediately.  What you think and saw was happening on the outside, was happening because of some very bizarre coincidences.Interesting addendum: In 1996 An episode of the TV series &quot;Dark Skies&quot; was based on this book's chapter about the Beatles' first U.S. appearance on a live broadcast of the Ed Sullivan Show in February of 1964.  Seen by 73 million viewers across the nation, (that's almost everyone who had a television set then), it was the perfect time to implant the message and test mass mind control.  Was it Tavistock who masterminded it all? This book has the answers, and raises even more questions that still don't but one day we may know the answer as more government documents become declassified regarding these operations.  (I'm hoping to see parts 2 and 3 of this trilogy get published with all of the events in Beatles and world history that have taken place since the book first came out in 1996.)",3.0,This book shows how the Beatles are tied into conspiracies,989971200.0,"05 16, 2001"

Ruairi takes his responsibilities as Laird very seriously and thanks to an earlier misunderstanding when they first met Ruairi thinks that Fliss is no more than a scheming opportunist out for all she can get.Fliss must take on the Laird and his eccentric family to convince them that she is passionate and determined and committed to make the therapy centre a success, before Ruairi puts a stop to her dreams before she can turn them into reality and she finds herself unemployed and back in London; two people from completely different backgrounds. The Laird is set in his ways and stubborn. Will Fliss be able to convince him that she is not what he thinks she is?With enough sparks to set off fireworks, this is a fabulous romance story from author Lizzie Lamb. A fun and entertaining read from page one, engaging the reader straight away into the story that is written with excellent wit and humour that will make you smile. A cast of lively and thoroughly good fun characters that are so likable that some could have their own spin off stories. I loved everything about this book from the beautiful colour purple of the cover and the catchy title, to the escapism of getting lost in this great book for a few hours.

A1SHB1SJCDMVXP,0465021980,Chris C. Hill,"[0, 0]","The reviews ""Too much wrong"" and ""Physics from a non-physicist and it shows"" detail examples of how Professor Stein's text gets certain equations wrong in the physics topics under discussion.That would seem a damning blow in a volume on constants in physics. On the other hand, the professor makes no claims to being a physicist. Rather, he is a professor of mathematics at California State University, Long Beach.Other mathematically oriented authors such as Ivars Peterson have written engaging and insightful books on physics topics (Peterson's ""Newton's Clock: Chaos in the Solar System"" is one such; Roger Penrose's magisterial ""The Road to Reality"" is another). In this spirit I read ""Cosmic Numbers"" looking for insights that a mathemetician might bring to the subjects.Astonishingly (because Basic Books used to be such a high quality publisher), what are found are ""insights"" that would be counted as errors on a high-school level physics test.An early example in the book comes when Professor Stein offers a mathematical excursus on the speed of light in the section 'Faster Than a Speeding Photon' (pp. 25-28). Anyone who has studied math knows that insights in the Land of Tautology often arise by introducing a new layer of abstraction or a ""catalytic"" and extraneous variable into an expression or equation. Stein does exactly that in this section to show how it is mathematically possible for a beam of light from a lighthouse to move faster than the speed of light. It's a little ""fun fact.""The problem is that Professor Stein's fun fact founders when he gets (on page 26) to the inequality R - qc is greater than (the square root of R^2 + d^2) - d. Here's why: R is a variable of distance. So is d. So is the square root of R^2 and d^2. But qc is a variable of time^2. It is nonsense to add distance and time^2 to each other, not to mention putting distance alone on the other side of an inequality. This, alas, is but one of the misconceptions that riddle the excursus from beginning to end. Stein has a playful, curious mind that may be engaging in a classroom setting, but it apparently lacks the focus and discipline to provide reliable insight into physics.In the introduction to the volume, Professor Stein writes a paean to his editor at Basic Books. It may well be that the editor provided the volume with the ""fun, friendly"" style praised in one 5-star Amazon review. However, no competent editorial hand is evident in the many substantive errors that give the volume its distinctive flavor. I've never written a 1-star review before, and I take no pleasure in doing so, but if any popular science volume has earned a strong caveat emptor, it is this one.",1.0,A misfire,1386892800.0,"12 13, 2013"

In Robison Wells' Blackout, a virus has changed some teens into powerful individuals who could rival the X-Men.Aubrey's secret landed her a connection to the most powerful girl in school, and as a result, she has gotten a taste of popularity. She had to ditch her previous friends, but becoming invisible at will has been a gateway into the popular crowd. Unfortunately, now that she is there, she isn't sure she wants to stay there. At the school dance, her invisibility lets her hear just what people really think of her, but her own self-torture is cut short when a group of soldiers storm the school and round up the kids. Luckily, her invisibility helps her escape, but not before she watches her date hulk out and attack the soldiers. After he is killed in front of everyone, Aubrey realizes she has to get out of there. She sees Jack, a friend from what feels like another lifetime, and they manage to escape, but they know life as they knew it has changed.Meanwhile, Laura, Dan and Alec are following through with their mission. As they attack specific targets using their powers, they know they are achieving maximum damage, not only to their targets, but also to the American sense of security. When they appear to be trapped, however, they will go to great lengths to escape, even if it means sacrificing one or more of the group. As they get split up, the world around them is scrambling to try and stop the terrorist attacks. But that isn't easy when you are fighting your own adolescent population who have powers the government can't even fully understand yet. With no choice but to fight fire with fire, the government makes a bold decision: kids with powers can help in the fight against the other kids with powers. In a draft like no other, the newly talented children of the United States find themselves with a decision that will forever change their lives... again.While the few plot holes and multiple POVs that narrate the story were occasionally in the con column for me with this story, I actually really enjoyed it overall. The powers of the kids were fascinating, and since the kids weren't born with them, there was a great element of &#34;coming into your own&#34; with whatever ability you got. Some were scary (the ability to compel people to do anything) and some appeared trivial (the ability to change the color of something), but kids were at different stages of comfort with their new-found abilities, and the adjustment period was intriguing. I also really liked Aubrey and Jack, so following them around became my favorite part of the story. Of course, Laura, Alec, and Dan's parts of the story were creepy, to say the least, but there was more to that story than we get in this installment of the new series.That was one of the biggest plot holes. We know there is a purpose for Laura, Alec, and Dan's destruction, and the government explains the systematic attacks, but we never really find out who or what is behind the terrorist activities. Someone is certainly leading them, but even the kids don't have the full story. While it was definitely a plot hole, I suspect it will be cleared up in installments to come and the hole didn't really interfere with your understanding of the story. You will find yourself trying to figure out who it could be, but you can still understand the story without that information. Also, the multiple POVs can be confusing occasionally, but I thought Wells did a good job of bouncing around and still keeping the reader focused and connected. I have seen this technique go horribly awry before, but Wells was quite adept at it. I also know this technique is a &#34;love it or hate it&#34; move, so if you don't like multiple POVs, this story will certainly bug you.This was a fun and intriguing start to a promising series, and I am looking forward to where Robison goes with it.

Nevertheless I was one of those who listened, listened again, and stopped listening to it for a very long time.  I was disappointed to say the least, so I moved back to their older stuff.  That was until I caught one of their shows in Rochester NY, and let me tell you, after seein them live twice, once for the honda civic tour and once for that tour, I have to say they are the most amazing live rock band.  I gav me a whole new appreciation for their new material, and honestly the songs are 100x better live.  With that said, onto the recorded versions.  The CD is more of that retro rock everyone is into lately, whcih was disappointing, but it sort of made up for itself with a little intricate work and here and there in the CD.  What got me was all the catchy riffs you hear thoughout most of the songs.  Even if you hate the CD you might find yourself singing one of those songs.  This CD lacked the complete intricacy I was hoping for leaving some boring songs.  Although it still has good riffs here and there, its nothing overly impressive, so if your looking for the dazzling Incubus this is not the place to be.

I saw it for 99 bucks today at Costco and THAT is why I am writing to let folks know that as of 11/7 it is already on the shelf and barely under a hundred bucks. I have the previous edition and from what I understand nothing (other than packaging) has changed....This show followed a small group of men throughout WW2 and while the Lt Hadley (Rick Jason) was picked to be the star , in short order Sargent Saunders , played by Vic Morrow , stole the show out from under his pretty nose and became a hero to all us kids in the 60's. Shot on the back lot in Los Angeles and featuring directors like Richard Donner and the late great Robert Altman and guest stars galore from James Coburn to Lee Marvin... this collection is essential to my DVD collection. The first seasons were all black and white with the final in Color.  In my opinion the series didn't yet run out of gas but was pulled for other reasons.  There are some fun commentaries and interesting bonus features..This doesn't feature action and gun play that compares to the CGI films and shows of today but it had enough for us kids and really fun and interesting characters in the platoon... and as guests with really gutsy and compelling episodes.  While many of my childhood fantasy shows like The Wild Wild West haven't worn well with the years I enjoy this show very much. It isn't on the level of The Twilight Zone as an all time classic but its in the ball park for me.

A1B94XOERT75GN,B00CAW3G66,Mad Hatter Reads,"[1, 1]","I received an e-Book from the author in exchange for an honest reviewThere's more to Pierced than just being an up-and-coming Urban Fantasy series. In fact, even though the main characters have touches of the supernatural; the supernatural aspects aren't the main focus. With this first installment of the series, it's more about the characters humanity and how they cope and react when what they hold precious is threatened. The supernatural aspects are subtly woven into the story and like Pierce, we're not really sure if they are real or imagined.Pierced isn't going to be a read for everyone. Pierce endures horrific child abuse, and while she is now twenty-one we do experience portions of it in the form of nightmares. The abuse has left major emotional, mental and physical scars on Pierce, and I applaud Mells with how she portrays the psychological effects this has on her and the methods that Pierce used/uses to cope with it.There's plenty of action throughout the story and both Pierce and 10-year old Mia prove to be excellent fighters. They even have the good sense to know that there are times when you should just run as well as times to stand and fight. Tensions are broken up with wry humor, usually from the characters (the other Pierces: Mildred and Veda) living in our Pierce's head.Mells also does a wonderful job with her world-building. We get a full understanding of the supernatural and human aspects of the world and some of the history of what Pierce has had to go through in her short life. There were a couple of time-frame issues, but nothing that was overly jarring or pulled me out of the story. All the characters are very well written and play intricate roles to the story. I'm looking forward to seeing how they grow and develop over the series.Pierced is labeled UF/PNR, but there isn't any romance going on in this installment. Pierce is still too shattered to even consider it. But there are hints and potential attractions that in later books could (and hopefully will) bloom into a HEA for Pierce.Also, fair warning...the story ends with a cliff-hanger and it's a doozy (made me want to scream!), so hopefully we won't have to wait to long to find out what happens in book 2, Pinked.",4.0,Mad Hatter Reads Review Pierced,1374019200.0,"07 17, 2013"

I am happy to report that, at least in my case, that the problems that initially plagued the season 5 blu ray (audio sync and incompatibility with certain disc players) seem to have been resolved. The discs played just fine for me, and there was no apparent problems with the sound. I am totally happy with my purchase. My only complaint is the shoddy packaging, which is the only reason I gave it four stars instead of five. Seasons one and two were gorgeously packaged and loaded with great artwork and production info. Seasons 3-5 appear to be done on the cheap, which is very disappointing. That one minor quibble aside, I would definitely recommend this to any Star Wars fan out there. Season 5 had some of the best storylines of the entire series. The Darth Maul/Deathwatch story arc was fantastic, and the season ending arc with Ashoka being framed for murder was very powerful and emotionally charged, considering that this is a show aimed primarily at young people. It does not dumb down its material or condescend to its audience. Indeed, I think the Clone Wars is one of the strongest sci fi shows of the last few years, both in terms of production and the writing.

There are still those who refuse to yield to science, logic, and observable fact, and feel as though science and religion must be mutually exclusive.  Richard Dawkins points out that this is not the case.  Whether or not there is an ultimate creator is left up to the reader, yet at the same time it should be noted that evolution has occurred, is occurring, and will continue to occur.  Furthermore, it occurs without a predestined design.  Evolution by natural selection is no longer regarded as theory by most in the field.  It has been observed both in the laboratory and in nature.The ""Blind Watchmaker"" of this book refers to Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection.  For, the watch is an intricate piece of machinery that surely requires a watchmaker to piece together all it's inner workings.  The analogy has been made (specifically in Rev. William Paley's ""Natural Theology"") that the universe as we know it can be seen as an intricate working similar to that of a watch, and thus the universe must also have a maker of it's own.  Dawkins points out that if one chooses to go along with this analogy, then evolution by natural selection would be the watchmaker, and this maker is indeed blind.  Blind in the sense that evolution has no direction, no goals, and no predetermined stopping point.Dawkins uses extremely convincing analogies such as the intricacies of the eye, the sonar used by bats, and even several computer simulations, using programs he wrote, to support his arguments.  Small changes, mutations, give rise to phenotypic traits that are advantageous to a particular species, or a subset of a species, and thus this mutation persists.  Over geologic time, then, a few small photoreceptor cells may eventually become the eyes we know of today.As a biology major, this book was a must-read.  However, one thing I really loved about this book is that you don't have to be a biology major to understand and appreciate the points Dawkins makes.  He draws the reader through his analogies and explanations using simple layman's terms, and everyday examples that are easily understood.  My only complaint is that some of his examples can be rather long-winded, redundant, and circuitous.  Indeed, Dawkins can be rather verbose at times.  Nonetheless, I feel that this is a must-read book for anyone who is either still on the fence with regards to creationist theory, or anyone who wants to open their eyes to some easily digestible science.  Overall this was a very well written argument for a universe without design, and this theory, if not this book, should not be overlooked.",4.0,A Universe Without Design,1086048000.0,"06 1, 2004"

He's a very talented writer with a knack for fleshing out a diverse array of colorful characters, and that makes this book appealing both to the interested layman, as well as all but the most curmudgeonly financial professional.The book takes us back to Saloman's bond arbitrage desk, where the enigmatic John Meriwether first mastered some of the convergence strategies he and the brain trust would later use to great effect in Greenwich.Then we learn some about how the fund's management was constructed, all the various places they drew money from, and ultimately observe the masters in action, placing their token efficient market bets that yield spreads just couldn't get any wider. All this leads up to 1998, where even early in the year certain cracks in the hull began to appear; namely concerns over vanishing opportunities in the bond arbitrage market (the rifraff had become wise to some of the professors' token strategies, thereby eliminating their effectiveness), and LTCM's extensions into fields beyond its expertise,  particularly merger arbitrage. All this leads to the perfect storm of 1998, when the fund's short volatility positions exploded in a summer storm of apocalytic proportions. Lowenstein chronicled the actual debacle superbly.One quibble is Lowenstein's cautioning reptition of how dangerous it is for traders/investors to use historical patterns to get a read on how the market might look in the future. While I agree that it's dangerous to bet 10,000% of your equity on the likelihood of a particular pattern repeating, one can't really trade without a healthy understanding of historical precedent. In the financial markets, history does repeat itself more often than not. So, I think LTCM's debacle was more the result of its gargantuan margin than a horrible, fatal flaw in its trading models.All that aside, this is a great book, as fun to read as it is informative.Highly Recommended",5.0,Eminently readable account of a complex debacle,1137110400.0,"01 13, 2006"

I decided to buy my 1st gas grill and just get the best.I have been using it for over three months now.Assembly: while I'm far from being able to assemble anything, I was able to successfully assemble this grill.It took me two full hours, but I was able to perform it without any mistake. (I needed my wife help to get it out of the box!).My only suggestion would be to use the (provided) plastic butterfly instead of the metal wrench to tighten the nuts: it is easier and less prone to be overtightened.As far as parts fitting: they snaps together with no effort.Use: leaving in California, external temperatures are not extreme, so:- two burners are enough to reach temperatures in excess of 500 F (sometimes not even on Max)- it takes less then 5 minutes to get hot (in excess than 450)To my disappointment the heat is not even: the burners are longer on one side, creating an (uniform) hotter area there. It may become some sort of a problem when the grill is fully loaded with food. If you don't grill your steaks on the edges, you won't even notice it.The flavored bars are the most positive surprise: they are just as great as the cast iron bars, although cheaper to replace and easier to maintain.The side trays are small: ok the left one, but the right has the side mounted controls, leaving room for salt and pepper only.Flare-ups are a thing of the past (but remember to clean the grease tray once in a while!!)the grilling area is big enough to accommodate a dinner for 5 (steaks and veggies)Note: I have been using charcoal grills for over 20 years and I was highly skeptical on gas grills.Although I still use the charcoal one once in a while, my grilling default is the spirit now.I cook chicken, filet mignon, ribs, steaks, vegetables and its convenience is stunning!Details:The electrical starter is impressing in its functionality.Wheels are probably the best you can wish.Compared to Weber Genesis (my other weber alternative):it clearly has lower quality components, but I can live with (stiff and resistant) plastic handles and less refined doors.cooking area is smaller, but it has enough room for 6 big steaks and if you pack them a little bit you can put up to 8 together.The Genesis looks nicer and has greater color selection.I also bought the Weber Premium Gas Grill Cover For Spirit 200/300 Series Grills.

As I've stated before, the first romance books that she wrote many years ago, I thought were beautiful and well-written. A writer develops a certain type style of their very own. Roberts has done just that. Unfortunately, some of the latest books that have been published with this author's name on them, just didn't hold water that she even wrote those books. They lacked her &quot;certain&quot; style, which is a wonderful mark when she writes. HOWEVER, this book had Nora's style-stamp and I loved it. I doubt that Nora has taken a crash course in Wicca101 to write so well about the Craft, so she either did some thoroughly extensive research, or she had the help of some sisters. No matter, I love a wonderful romance story and this trilogy didn't let me down. At least I haven't lost faith that Nora does still pen a few of her own books. As for Nora writing about magic, well think about it.  Isn't romance started between two people by a spark? Sure it is. Obviously, if everyone wanted to read the same thing, a lot of writers would be in serious trouble. So you'll have conflicting opinions about any book. I've given Nora a few less stars on some of her more recent books, but believe me, this is Nora Roberts writing at her best. I really did enjoy this book. I would recommend it to anyone that loves to read romance. The love between Sam and Mia never died, the flame was just lowered. I thought Sam Logan was a great character. And I also thought the final story of this trilogy was HER BEST. That's the romantic in me.",5.0,This book has the Nora Roberts old style,1027209600.0,"07 21, 2002"

A17EWXEFBXHAZ3,1940071038,Trish Santos,"[0, 0]","Let me start off by saying that this book was not at all what I expected, yet it turned out to be exactly what I was craving. It takes place in Hawaii and has two extremely hot surfer guys in it, so what&#8217;s not to like? Okay, but seriously, the book hooked me from the beginning. Mallory has just landed in Hawaii to spend the summer with her best friend, Sunny, and the first person she meets is Evan. Sexy, surfer, arrogant, playboy Evan *sigh*. They sleep together that same night. I know! It&#8217;s like, wait what? That so doesn&#8217;t happen in real life! Well, it apparently does to Mallory, and it was HOT. But, they both have emotional baggage and clearly, they don&#8217;t know each other very well, so the morning after does not end well at all.Later, Mallory goes to work with Sunny and enter hot guy number two. Noah is sweet and is content to be friends with Mallory as long as they slowly move towards more. Evan comes to the same restaurant, and there&#8217;s some kind of guy standoff for Mallory. Evidently Evan and Noah are used-to-be-best-friends-but-now-enemies. For some reason, as much as the author tried to make it a love triangle, I was always Team Evan. I didn&#8217;t even give Noah a second thought really. He was just kind of there. Mallory only goes out with him for a few reasons. First, to try to get over Evan, which is not going to happen. Second, she thinks she wants to be friends with him. She falls asleep the first time they hang out, and with Evan there is no sleeping, if you know what I mean. How is there even a choice?But, alas, there are lots of problems with the concept of Evan and Mallory. They&#8217;re pretty dysfunctional actually, however, that&#8217;s what makes them work. Unfortunately, they have one of those relationships where if it&#8217;s good, then it&#8217;s REALLY good. But if it&#8217;s terrible, then everyone around them becomes miserable, too. That&#8217;s just another reason to root for them. But, I kind of like how it took them forever to figure their stuff out, it means more angst and drama. I&#8217;ll admit the story did get repetitive at times. She starts to accept her feelings about him, they are happy, he messes up, they push each other away, they sulk for a few days, they have a confrontation, they have sex, it&#8217;s all good, and then one of them messes up again. Well, at least they keep it interesting. They also epitomize the whole fighting-leads-to-great-makeup-sex thing. They have insane chemistry, and it&#8217;s ridiculous how either of them even try to fight it.I love Evan. He&#8217;s a blue-eyed surfer boy. He is straightforward with women and he likes sex. He is insanely smart. He&#8217;s arrogant on the outside, and sweet on the inside. He has parent issues, but he and his older sister are adorable together. He, like most men, don&#8217;t know what to do when they fall for a girl. Mallory turns his world completely upside down. She actually didn&#8217;t annoy me as much as I thought she would, maybe because she reminds me of me. She comes to Hawaii looking for fun, especially since she just got out of a stupid relationship. She is no-nonsense, smart, witty, and one of those pretty and they don&#8217;t know it girls. She keeps Evan on her toes. She tries to protect her heart, but I mean, with a guy like Evan it has to be hard. I also liked the other love stories going on around them. Evan&#8217;s best friend, Zach, with Mallory&#8217;s best friend, Sunny, and then there&#8217;s also Evan&#8217;s other best friend, Murphy, with Evan&#8217;s older sister, Kate. Their family-like bond had me cracking up at times and aww-ing at others.One last thing, this book is NOT a standalone. I did not know that going into it, and I had a rude awakening when suddenly I was at a sneak peek for book two without even knowing I was at the end. It&#8217;s not necessarily a cliffhanger ending, which I would&#8217;ve hated, but it has LOTS of loose-ends left to worry about. Oh, and a torturous teaser for the next book. What&#8217;ll happen when summer ends, and Mallory has to go back to Colorado? Guess we&#8217;ll have to wait and see&#8230;",5.0,Gahhh love S.L. Scott,1374624000.0,"07 24, 2013"

A2K5MN1OE6UPXF,B00JQLC67Y,Lynn Worton,"[1, 1]","I received a complimentary copy of this book from the author in return for an honest review.This is the third story in the Master of Whitehall series. I really enjoyed it!Dale is a very likable character. He is a thirty-five year old vampire in a sixteen year old's body. I liked him a lot. He has not had an easy life, and when he meets Charlotte Ann, James and Katelyn, he was depressed and lonely. This is his story.I have been looking forward to reading Dale's story, as I found his character to be most intriguing. I really felt for this character, because his life had been irrevocably changed by a selfish vampire who wanted a companion. The story ventures into Dale's past and gives the reader a better understanding of this young man. I liked him when I first met him in the first book, but fell in love with him in this one. He is quite charming, but can be extremely deadly to his prey. Charlotte Ann has a calming influence on him, and gives him a sense of love and security. She is a patient teacher and lover; Dale blossoms under her tutelage. James and Katelyn, and later Lexi, gives him a sense of family.I actually enjoyed this story more than the previous two. Perhaps it's because the author is more at ease writing from the male point of view, rather than the female one. There is no gushing dialogue, which made this book a pleasure to read. In fact, I think the story flowed better because of the more straight forward dialogue. Dale may look like a teenager, but he has a maturity about him, not only because of his age, but because of his experiences. There are a few twists in the story, and a surprise (which I kind of guessed at before it happened), but this just kept me hooked from beginning to end. The story ended on a happy note, which left me feeling pleased for Dale, as he deserved a little happiness.Rick Veal has written an intriguing series of love, friendship and emotional growth. His characters are lifelike and likable. His writing style has improved a lot. The flow of the story was much better, and this kept me turning the pages. I do not know if there will be any more books in this series, but even if there are not, I would definitely read more of this authors work in the future.There are some scenes of a sensual nature that are a little on the hot side (although not as explicit as some books I have read), so I do not recommend this book for younger readers.

He is a fine song writer but doesn't mind giving other great songwriters their due by covering their songs (e.g Mama's Opry by Iris Dement.)

I am getting tired of so many bluegrass albums sounding alike.  Also check out a superb previous solo album, Wanderlust. He has two excellent duet and/or duo albums with phenomenal musician and former Winfield National flatpick guitar contest winner, Peter McLaughlin - So Long Arizona and Canyoneers. He also headed up a Bluegrass supergroup - Perfect Strangers (album name eponymous) with  with Peter, Jody Stecher, and former Bluegrass Boys Bob Black and the late Forrest Rose. I would also recommend Kentucky Rose's album if you can find it - that album first featured a song written and performed by Chris, Mason's Lament. Lament has been covered by multiple artists including Lynn Morris, Tom Rozum and Chris himself on a later album (Wanderlust.)

Heats up quicky to a warm temperature that is just right to make my feet feel heated, without being too hot.  (I haven't needed the higher setting - so I haven't tested it).The 45 minute auto-shutoff seems like a good safety feature. I know that it turned off when I start to feel my feet getting a little chilly. But it's easy enough to see that the lights are off, and then just tap the 'on' button with my toes to turn it back on for another 45 mins.I took one star off for the hard plastic bumpy top (not uncomfortable to my feet, but a softer rubbery surface would probably be more comfortable), and for the stiffness of the sliders (I can't change the angle of the footrest with my feet, which I was hoping to do based on some other reviews).  Some may like that permanent position (too much wiggle could have its own problems), but my preference would have been for the footrest to allow my feet to shift it smoothly when I need to stretch my ankles.After reading some other reviews: It seems that if you get a footrest that's too hot for sock-feet on the lower setting, you may have gotten a defective model that could melt.

Knowing of some corruption going on in a local landscaping business, he goes undercover to bust the guy he believes is responsible for transporting a lot of illegal aliens into Texas.The Suspense:Great!

It's small and easy to store in my closet on one of the racks.First off, I'm impressed by the build quality. It feels appropriately hefty and sturdy in the hand. The gasketed screw cap and threads are made of metal, which I was not expecting. There's no chance of this breaking at all from use. The 3-prong power chord is thick and heavy gauge, the same as you'll find coming out the back of your computer.So far, my uses for this are to steam my counter tops, toilet area, and sinks. The included hose is 3 feet long and other attachments let you steam surfaces like carpets and sofas. Another attachment is for shampooing. A little pitcher is also included for filling the steamer, which is a nice touch so you don't have to place the unit under a faucet (a potential shock hazard). I have no problems operating it one-handed. The spring return on the trigger does feel a bit strong, but I use 2 fingers. It is easier this way and less fatiguing. To lock the trigger requires you to use another hand to engage and disengage the lever. It's situated in a strange location that prevents one-handed operation.

AR60XAZVNIUIU,B001P27ZVE,Patricia,"[1, 1]","I bought this camera on Ebay for $34 and it's worth every penny.  I did my homework and read the reviews, so I knew that the installation was going to take more time than the package implies.  I'm not a mechanic, but I'm comfortable using tools, so the installation took me around 2 hours. I highly recommend going on Youtube and watching the ""How-to"" videos they have available for the Peak wireless camera installations. You will get a general idea of how to install the camera, but you might need to modify some of the instructions based on your particular vehicle.I bought my camera to fit a GMC Safari and it took more than a few minutes to figure out how to place the camera without blocking my license plate. The tools than I used were a power drill, screwdriver, and pliers. Tape and acrylic glue was also used. The instructions are fairly simple.  The hard part was accessing the back panel and threading the wires (yes there are wires)through the door and into the interior of my van. The reviews I've read said that the transmitter should be placed high and as close to the screen as possible for the best resolution on the LCD monitor. I didn't want the cables to be visible so I tucked them behind the plastic moldings and zip-tied the transmitter securely right above the right rear window. It's hardly noticeable.I then plugged in the LCD screen into the power outlet(cigarette lighter)in front. The instructions tell you to affix the suction cupped mount to your window, but I couldn't get mine to stick. Based on other reviews I've read, this is a common problem.  I ended up securing the monitor inside a cubby hole under the radio. I turned it on and it worked perfectly.  My screen is 2.4 inches, and while it does the job, I think most people would prefer a larger screen.  But even with a larger screen, there is no substitute for caution and doing a physical walk around before backing up.I've only just installed it, but so far I'm very pleased.  The picture is clear, bright, and detailed enough so I can see what's behind my van. This is the first time I've installed after-market equipment on one of my vehicles. It took me longer than I wanted, but I feel quite pleased with myself that it actually works. If the only time you've ever used a tool was to crack walnuts, you might want to get it professionally installed. But if you are moderately handy, able to follow instructions, or unafraid to try, you should be able to install this camera yourself with miminal effort.  And at less than $40, the price is right for that extra measure of safety.",4.0,"Not wireless, installs in minutes(around 120), and bigger screen would be nice.",1382227200.0,"10 20, 2013"

Zubok writes that ideology formed the basis for Stalins decisions regarding Germany. Stalin thought that his proposals for a neutral Germany and socialism in Eastern Germany would be enough for the Germans to flock to the Soviet cause. When this did not proved out to be true, Stalin militarized Eastern Europe for fear of a  Western Germany with Western backing. Khruschev did not want to end the Cold War because he thought that Communism would eventually triumph and that he force the West to back down through the fear of nuclear war. Brezhnev implented detente because he feared war, but when he became ill, hard liners took over decision making and invaded Afghanistan. Gorbachev abandoned hardline Communist ideology and thought that a type of European Social Democracy would take over Eastern and this led to the Soviets leaving Eastern Europe in 1989.

A1OBNY1WB38LMI,0393321029,R. M. Peterson,"[1, 1]","SOMETHING IN THE SOIL is a collection of essays relating to the ""history of the New West"" (or ""the new history of the West"") with which Limerick is associated.  Some of the essays are recycled, and some were not previously published.  Limerick tries to impose some order by grouping them in five Parts, but still the book has a mildly disjointed feel, though Limerick's distinctive style and voice provides some unity.What Limerick brings to the table is a willingness to reconsider and examine anew many issues, including many myths, associated with the American West, and to discuss them clearly and cogently.  Although the book was published eight years ago (and several of the essays originally published longer ago than that), the essays are still sufficiently relevant to warrant reading them.  And the reading will be much easier and enjoyable than is the case with the work of most university historians.  Limerick makes it a point to avoid academic jargon and tortured syntax (indeed, one of the essays addresses the problems seemingly endemic to academic writing), and she has achieved a distinctive voice, rather informal and casual, yet honest and sincere.She also is to be commended for re-thinking and, where she finds it appropriate, revising her earlier work, including ""The Legacy of Conquest,"" which was published in 1987 and elevated Limerick to the front rank of ""New West"" historians.  Occasionally, her points or arguments strike me as a little far-fetched or over-the-top, but at least she is lively and provocative.",4.0,"Worthwhile essays on the ""New West""",1215648000.0,"07 10, 2008"

AQVQQD3ECI21Z,0307446441,Jena,"[1, 1]","The Dragon and the Turtle is a wonderful book about an unusual friendship between a dragon named Padraig and a turtle named Roger.  It is written  by a mother and daughter team, Donita K. Paul and Evangeline Denmark and is illustrated by Vincent Nguyen.First let me say that as I was beginning to write this review, my five year old son asked what I was doing and I told him that I was writing a book review and he asked what that was.  I said, ""I have to tell whether I liked the book or not.""  He saw what book I had in my hand and said, ""I love it!  It's a great book about friends.""The book is for pre-school children or children in early elementary school.  It is very appropriate because this is the age that they are really learning about friendships and maybe even establishing a friendship that may last a lifetime.Padraig puts off doing some things that he wanted to do for himself to help Roger, a turtle he just met.  Roger is lost and needs help finding his way back home.  Padraig tries his best to help Roger.  If you read between the lines, it is also a book about patience. As Padraig tries to help Roger, he has to try many many times before he is successful.The book also teaches about the 5 senses.  Roger describes his house to Padraig by telling what it looks like, what it sounds like, what it smells like, what it feels like and what it tastes like.In the story, Roger's house smells like cookies, Chocolate Chip Snappers to be exact.  When the friends finally find Roger's house, Roger's mother gives the two friends some Chocolate Chip Snappers.  As an added bonus, there is a recipe for the Chocolate Chip Snappers.  (If you made a batch of these and while they were in the oven baking you read this story to your child, what a great story it would be.  Your children would be able to experience their five senses the whole time.)I recommend this book for younger children.  It is wonderfully illustrated with colorful and delightful pictures, the story is very appropriate for the age it is written and my children loved it.

The notes offer solid and positive helps in all these areas. The NKJV itself is a solid, word-for-word translation of what some feel are the better Greek texts. That of course, is debatable.The Bible itself comes in navy or black bonded leather, with Nelson's unpleasant habit of installing ribbon markers that barely extend beyond the bottom of the page. I guess they feel it would cost them an arm and a leg to make the ribbon marker longer. The Bible is glue-bound, so it is not going to last you a particularly long time.

APEYI6416RAS1,B000GUDGZ0,"Christina E. Butler ""connected to source and ...","[35, 36]","The original review stands save one thing not known at that time.  Amazon stocks old product and I found that out after going to the manufacture to say why did these handles fall off?  you have an issue... first question was did you buy from amazon?  They knew exactly what the problem was and it had been fixed for some time.  Handle design was completely changed because after months of wear they fall off... not an issue for short term uses... so you can save the coin here on amazon but if you need cruthces long term buy latest version at Millenum Medical directly... Awesome company... will make good on anything and everything.. never an issue awesome customer support.  They have redesigened these for 2013 coming out soon and the cost is going up in feb? 2013 do not know what it will be but they sent out warning emails to customers to buy now if you want to avoid the increase... supposedly fixing some issues.. I have yet to see.  They do cost more that these on amazon at old prices but not a lot and shipping is not free from them... but for me ... someone on crutches permanently for daily use for 25+ years now there is no subistitute.  These are the best innovation in crutches since metal ones where introduced.I am a LOOOOOOOONNNNNNNNNGGGGG term crutch user over 20 years now and counting.  These crutches are EXCELLENT and the cost does not reflect the quality of this product.  The quality is similar to the idea we used to say they don't make them like that anymore... well Mellennial does make them with old time quality at today's average crutch cost... with this you are truly getting your money's worth.  Over all Quality is VERY VERY GOOD.  These crutches are sturdy... and actually have more shaft strength than the traditional aluminum crutch.  I can bend those shafts much easier than I could these.  IF you are a short time user... don't worry about these... get them... Truth is you are going to hate being on crutches because it is a PAIN period... but these are SOOOOOOOOOOOOOO much better than traditional crutches it is worth it... the experience on these will be FAR FAR less exhausting and less frustrating.  GO FOR IT.If you are a long term user like me and you have to be careful about what you trust and need to be concerned about your ability to function in your world with these.. the detailed review below is what I wanted to know before taking the plunge with these.... but I am very glad I did.Handle... is extremely sturdy and fairly heavy.  Normal crutches require padding and fussing with for me... I was concerned about the hard look of these handles... they are softer feeling than they look (its like a smooth slightly cushy bendable without changing shape rubbery feel, but not stick rubber... smooth almost like coated) and I have had no need or desire to pad them... they are perfect feeling as they are not too hard or slippery (unless wet but they wipe off and dry up easily even if you don't have a towel or something you can do it with your hand).  The other thing that is REALLY NICE about that is that I can clean these and sanitize these easily... Not possible for traditional crutch handles altered or unaltered... that material is porous and sponge like... this is not and it is very very easy to keep them clean HUGE HUGE improvement.. AND A MUST FOR KIDS OR DD.  My regular crutch handles would get NASTY and I would have had to spend a fortune buying new ones to keep them somewhat cleaner.The handle shape is comfortable but took me a bit of reworking my traditional hand position to get the hang of it and i had some discomfort initially... but I think that was due to me using traditional crutches for so long and so often I had to retrain my learned motor patterns for this new and better handle and hand position.  after about a week I was very good with it.  There are some significant differences, but they are positive.  The weight baring is shifted to the ball of the saddle joint and heel of the palm on the thumb side while the back side (distal side of palm heel) no longer bares any weight.  Better but took adjustment for me a long time user.  First timers or irregular crutch users should not notice this.Handle attachment and adjustments.  The screw is a SUPPER improvement in ease of getting on and off.  Much better than traditional wing nuts that break and crumble with long use.... The screw attachment is very smooth and easily adjusted which I recommend until you find the right combination of handle distance and hight adjustments for you personally.  This was greatly appreciated when I was figuring that out and needing to take them out and reposition frequently in the initial week or two of use.The only bad on the handle is that with EXTENDED (constant daily use to go anywhere)  They do start to loosen up.  I think that they need a secondary support on the underside.  But short term users even if short term and daily will not notice this until about 2 or 3 mons. of use.  Unless perhaps the person is very heavy like over 250 -300  that might make it worse sooner... just speculation...  This is NOT A DEAL BREAKER though.  It is an area of this product that improvement is needed but these crutches are still WAY WAY better than the traditional alternatives.Height Adjustments on Shaft are just like traditional crutches but higher quality parts on these crutches... they are extremely well made and substantial feeling without extra weight.  By far the weight from these crutches resides in the heavy handle because of the design it has to be and if they cost a little more than the traditional crutch in price it is deserved, you won't feel ripped off by these.  The crutches have a very cool paint on them that takes that metallic feel of uncovered aluminum shafts that feels like nails on a black board away... they feel more like a bicycle coated paint...not quite that thick and heavy though... it is a very good improvement over the uncoated metal... they are smoother, slicker feeling.  They do scratch and scuff, but less noticeable, it doesn't look as tacky when these get scuffed.  Also when my traditional crutches got dinged or gouged they would often leave a sharp or rough edge that could actually scrape or even cut you... these have not done that and the scuffs scratches feel smooth and more cosmetic than the deep ones I could get on the old crutches.The Arm Pads -  I was skeptical about these based on the pictures... but I must admit these are far superior to the traditional pad.  I have to duck tape material over the traditional crutches pads because it feels a bit better and the pads without a cover of some kind will wear and tear the hell out of my clothes with extended use over time.  These crutches require NO ADDITIONAL padding or covers seriously nothing else is needed.  They have been easy on my clothing and they are much more comfortable and less bulky feeling.  Sometimes I am not sure they are even there.  I am noting that they tend to slip away from the front end slightly... not much and you need to work them back up towards that end occasionally with a twisting and pulling motion slow but sure they flush up again.  (I'm talking like a 1/4 inch at most.The one negative to the Arm pads is this... because I am only 5'4 and I felt like I needed to get the short set.... the arm portion (flat bar at top) is smaller than it would be on the large size.  I like this most of the time but.... once in a while when I am not paying attention I have had one side slip out backwards on me.  This is a bit dangerous as it happens most often when I am leaning forward going down stairs or something.... but I have always caught myself.  Minor issue really, but you do need to be mindful of the arm position if you are an adult with the smaller size crutch.SPRINGS---- WAY WAY COOL.. do not fear this feature... embrace it fully... it is very subtle...after initial wow factor... these are NOT GOING TO CATAPULT you any where but they do ease some of the shock and push off requirements.  My shoulders and maybe in the wrists even more feel less tense and I fell like I use less energy on forward propulsion.  Here is the acid test.  try them going up stairs.  put crutches up first one stair then foot up two stairs (if you do this you know what I mean, I have learned over time how to go up stairs with crutches not feet first, this is an advanced skill).  The only down to these springs i found was this... after about only one month.... the crutches started to scrap and Grind during the spring part.  SCARED me at first.. thought they were defective... thought the spring was going to collapse from over use... it was an irritating feel and sound (NOT like fingernails on black board Far LESS harsh than that and not high pitched)  but irritating.  I thought maybe I was not being good about the angle... and I still don't know what was going on but it has now three mons later? it has all but stopped...maybe enough metal scrapped off and the groove is worn now but it doesn't do it any more.  AND I DO NOT WANT TO GIVE THESE UP ... will never go back to the others NEVER.  This issue could have been very serious but...  it appears to have corrected itself and it has not compromised the quality or performance of the crutch in any way that I can tell.  I am glad it stopped though.  I would say if that were to happen call the company... but you can probably ride it out in a short time if you are long time user.Tips... Supper impressed with their durability.  I went through traditional tips every couple of months that metal piece would always ware though the bottom then fall out and I would be walking on the end of the metal tip (plastic covered) and slipping all over the in door floors until I could get a new one?  welllllllll these tips are three months old and they look slightly worn on the bottom.... yes slightly like about 10% off original conditions and I AM NOT EASY ON TIPS... I walk all over outside and in all the time every day.  I think that spring thing helps with this.  Also they are much more multi directional in their surface grip than the traditional tips which get some what hard and brittle over time with age like two - three months.  These are supple still... bendy and you can put your crutch on a far lower angle to the floor and expect it to hold its place without slipping  I have tried like 60 degree angle estimate and it doesn't budge from the floor spot.  I also have noted less slipping in wet conditions... they do slip... but not as bad.Folding Feature - very very cool to have without in any way compromising the strength of the shaft.  I was concerned that feature would cause the shaft to be less sturdy or stable than the non folding shaft.  NOT SO.... It is accomplished with a button control just like the ones used for hight adjustments  and the two halves are kept attached when folded by thin but strong bungy style cord in side core.  EXCELLENTLY engineered.  This is not a feature you will want to use every time you sit or get in and out of a car... but when you will be there for a long time or not constantly getting in and out or simply don't have the space this is the coolest thing I've seen in a long time.  It is a MUST HAVE OPTION.Lastly I have also contacted the company.  They are real folks and they seem to care about customer service and care... I have not contacted them about problems however so I don' know the company from that angle, but i don't doubt that if something was wrong with these they would make it right one way or another.

A3BF2XIJKV5MQ1,0393072223,Andrew Gilbreth,"[0, 0]","The Shallows was an interesting read and Carr has some persuasive arguments about how our brains are changing. His main focus is regarding how our brains interpret information from written language. According to this book, our brain performs the tasks of finding and absorbing information very differently on the internet than it did with older mediums. This in turn has lead to our brains behaving differently; much to Carr's dismay, our ability for deep concentration, attention span, and memorization have all suffered. While Carr concedes that he likes the advantages the internet and technology have given us, he takes no firm stance on if the advantages are worth what we have lost.The book is just as much about how our brains have changed since the invention of written language as it is about the internet. Readers already familiar with the evolution of the written word may find these chapters of the book repetitive information. Carr does also offer some amusing asides and surprising facts along with the historical narrative, but the essence of &#34;how our brains are different today&#34; is mostly found in the beginning and ending sections of the book. Overall the knowledge and details Carr has collected make this worthy of the read, but be prepared for the accompanying history lesson.Carr has a fluid and occasionally humorous writing style (he even admits to the irony of trying to concentrate on reading a book about how it is harder to concentrate). Many chapters of the book are very dense with information, as Carr definitely did his research. An ending section about how to offset the effects of the internet might have been a nice addition.

I've really only dabbled in Yoga, though, so it may have some benefits I'm not really aware of.  As for the rest...Crunch Free Abs- Don't be fooled by the title, just because there's no crunches, doesn't mean it's easy... on the contrary, it's quite difficult. Some twisting, turning, and variation on pilates moves.Bikini Belly- I love this one!  It's a standing cardio segment, which helps to burn fat.  This is great because it's actually fun to do, and while it gets your heart rate up, you don't feel like your going to die.Waist Definer- It's all about twisting here!  Some very innovative twisting and rotational moves that really help to pull your waist in.Sexy Sporty Abs- some of your more basic crunch style moves and also some side plank raises.  Very good.The whole video is a good combination and it's not just a bunch of moves you've already seen.  Jessica is pretty and perky.  I liked her, even though she seemed just a tad too enthusiastic at times.

The software is also very basic, I found it to be somwewhat slow to act when prompted. Easier file naming for later retrieval to other programs would be a nice upgrade as well.

Certainly it will have to have one on Amazon, Goodreads and the like because they demand it, but Dear Teen Me is, to me, a book that transcends ratings.What is a rating, anyways? It is a mark of sometimes good technical storytelling, other times it is because of a person's simple like or dislike of a book. With Dear Teen Me, the former aspect especially holds no place.Dear Teen Me is not a story. It is a conglomeration of personal, nonfiction stories about the teen years of dozens of YA authors. The concepts of ""good technical storytelling"" do not apply. The content is just not that kind.I don't know what I thought when I requested an ARC of this book. Whatever it was, I only know that the book exceeded my expectations. I was certainly expecting a great deal of ""Were you an outsider in high school, because it's okay to be weird!"" and I got that, but not one of these stories was cheesy. Not one was a clich&eacute; of an adult trying to empower a teenager. The topics that these authors went over ranged from self-harm and eating disorders to coming out and dealing with abusive parents--and everything in between. Yes, every story had a happy ending and a moral, but you never felt like you were being told. All of the letters--though in some more than others--I felt as if I was intruding on someone's most personal journal entry, and the that raw emotion on display was not for my eyes.Dear Teen Me was not a book that I may have picked up of my own volition, simply because I am tired of books where ""former teens"" share their inspiring stories and tell you how to learn from them. I don't want to hear inspirational ""rah rah"" stories meant to make me feel better about myself because it's okay to be a broody teenager. The authors who contributed here seemed to understand that. No one is lecturing. No one is pretending that wounds leave no scars. No one is shying away from topics sometimes adults and teens alike are afraid of discussing. No one is censoring a thing.And why would they? They're writing these for themselves. For their mistakes. For their pain.

Each photo has an attached discussion. The introduction to the collection by Director Neal Benezna is short and sweet. The discussions of the history and esthetics of Victoria photography (hagiography, prelapsarian freedom, tableaux vivants, historical reconstructions, imaginary themes, etc.) by author Douglas R. Nickel is useful and accurate as it appeared entirely based on the authoritative biography of Carroll by Cohen and on the scholarly work of Karoline Leach in her book ""In the Shadow of the Dreamchild."" Like Lewis Carroll's photos, this book has the excellent quality of directness, and an aesthetic purity that springs from a delight in the beautiful.  Unfortunately, no nudes appeared in the exhibit and only one made its way into the book (Evelyn Hatch, figure 17, page 66.) That's a pity as it reflects badly on the freedom of artistic expression that Lewis Carroll championed. Another negative: The colored-in photos are not represented. They were interesting for many reasons and in a way anticipated the advent of color photography. I have five of them in my collection. They are truly beautiful and were photographed by Carroll and may have been colored by Carroll himself or by Miss Thompson, his woman friend.",3.0,Good for the Carroll collector or as a reminder of the exhibit,1167782400.0,"01 3, 2007"

The book looked good to me because I have loved other Zombie books that have swept the market of late. As a Christian I wanted to see how this connection would work and how the author could expand upon this crowded genre.The result was pretty good. At its worst CZK is an interesting and unique read within a Zombie allegory. At its best CZK is a kind of Screwtape Letters for the modern era, helping illuminate deeper truths with interesting fictional components. And although the genre isn't going to be for everyone, the truth and concepts presented are.The only thing I would change is the structure of the book. If the allegory is strong enough then you really don't need to explain it - in my opinion. The book is broken into chapters and sessions. The sessions are the story and the chapters explain things. This works well for the reader's ultimate understanding and helps ensure that there is little confusion but, again, I would have preferred allowing the reader to pick these truths up from the story itself. Depending on the age of the reader this was probably a good choice, especially for younger audiences.I would pick this book up if you are interested in mans struggle with sin, Zombies, or an interesting twist on literature, which is somewhat lacking from our current Christian bookshelf.I would have preferred to give this book 4.5 but limited by Amazon's rating system.

Because of the assembly, the kids lost interest 5 minutes in. The no-bake ""cake"" is textured just like Play-doh. The recommended 15-minute time in the refrigerator was not long enough, and we ruined one of the first batch of pops trying to apply the rock hard frosting to the mushy pop. After some more time in the refrigerator, my wife ended up frosting the remaining pops on her own, as the kids were long gone. Good luck getting the sprinkles to stick to the frosting.This product really is just overcomplicated. You don't need the pump/crank thing -- you could just put the batter directly into the mold.

So when I was looking for a book of short meditations to read in odd moments of the day, I selected ""One Liners.""When I opened the book, what I found was a treatise or sermon, spread out, sentence by sentence, on thick glossy pages. With a few notable exceptions, most of the sentences really don't stand alone as words of wisdom, but are part of a line of thought that Ram Dass is developing in each section of the book.  The one-line-to-a-page presentation breaks up the development of the thesis.The glossy pages suggest that this book is intended to be purchased as a gift.  I guess even gurus need to pay the rent, and I shouldn't begrudge Ram Dass this touch of commercialism.I believe that most of what Ram Dass says in this book is true, but I couldn't disagree more with him on the subject of psychedelics.  In ""Be Here Now"" he talks about a guru who didn't bat an eye when given a large dose of LSD.  It seems to me that guru was onto something that Ram Dass just didn't get. A reaction to a drug is a physiological phenomenon, not a religious experience.So--as usual, I'll keep the best and discard the rest.

In-between they honed their craft, played a lot of shows, and recently toured nationally, earning a slot at this year&#8217;s South By Southwest Festival.It&#8217;s no surprise a major breakthrough is on the cards; the Friendly People play an energized form of alt. rock, which sounds utterly contemporary, whilst incorporating all sorts of influences, including new folk, post-punk, Americana and progressive styles. When heard altogether the result is powerfully persuasive, complex yet natural, and remarkably approachable.There are seven permanent members of the band, including two drummers, and on &#8220;Shake&#8221; they&#8217;re joined by another dozen musicians and vocalists. The sound is always full and detailed, yet they somehow avoid confusion or cluttering their songs with excess. Songwriter Pat McCusker (he also sings and strums an acoustic guitar) revels in revealing abstractions, taking the listener on lyrical flights, which are to be deciphered to give meaning.His knack for the details is striking &#8211; on &#8220;Branches&#8221; there are some glorious lines and a memorable chorus, which is buoyed by swollen, swirling strings and things, before breaking like a high tide. Adventurous and daring, &#8220;Move&#8221; arrives on a slither of noise, overtaken almost immediately by an insistent beat and McCusker&#8217;s vocal. It builds beautifully, employing shades of early/mid period Talking Heads and fading into the six-minute &#8220;Maps&#8221;. A grand design of a song, in several parts, it thrills and confounds in equal measure.",5.0,Leicester Bangs Review (2013):,1385078400.0,"11 22, 2013"

What it contains is 90 different mini-essays on the topic, some of them containing advice and strategy, and some of them perhaps a little off-topic. Each essay is by a different creative artist or writer, which makes for a diverse and interesting blend of concepts, ideas, humor, and musings.I found some real gems of wisdom in this book, and though you'll have to dig for them, it's worth the effort--- they're that good, even if you may have heard them before. On the other hand, some of the essays are less helpful. For instance, one of them is a recipe for what looks like Cincinnati Chili. I love chili, and I guess the writer is suggesting that cooking a pot of chili will take your mind off your creative block, but this is hardly a ""proven strategy."" One essay writer says that he really doesn't have an answer. That may be an honest response, but again it's not a ""proven strategy"" or any strategy at all.Gladly, many of the writers provide concrete advice, from doing things to stimulate creativity to just plain slogging it out.This book will entertain you and provide you with some useful nuggets; far fewer than 90 of them, but still enough to make the work worth your time.",4.0,Quite useful but not exactly what the cover describes,1346284800.0,"08 30, 2012"

The colors are: yellow (40 cards), ""dark"" green (40 cards), light green (40 cards), ""dark"" red (40 cards), and light red (40 cards). The dark green and dark red are more intense versions of the light green and light red and almost impossible to tell apart; if you hold them right next to each other, you can sort of tell the difference but otherwise you can't.

A1K1JW1C5CUSUZ,0553287346,"Donald Mitchell ""Jesus Loves You!""","[16, 16]","Well-Schooled in Murder is a fascinating and critical look at social class, the traditions of English public schools and the problems with having a ""stiff upper lip.""  What is more remarkable is that those themes are developed in the context of an unusually complex and rewarding murder mystery.  This book barely misses becoming a classic in detective fiction and will greatly reward fans of Elizabeth George's series about Thomas Lynley and Barbara Havers and those who do not know the novels.This is the third book in the series.  You can read this book as a stand-alone, but it will work better for you if you first read A Great Deliverance and Payment in Blood.As the story opens, Lynley is still reeling from having destroyed his relationship with Lady Helen.  She's gone off to Greece and sends him occasional noncommittal post cards.  Lynley is burying himself in his work.  That's making life hard on Barbara Havers whose parents are not doing well.John Corntel, an old school chum from Eton, approaches Lynley for unofficial assistance in locating a missing student who was under the chum's care.  The situation soon changes when the student is found in an unlikely place dead, nude and having been tortured.  Lynley takes on the case to avoid having free time to mourn his lost love.  A delayed autopsy means that Lynley has to develop a sense of means, motive and opportunity without knowing the facts.  The various ""suspects"" and ""witnesses"" do their best to mislead him, adhering to a code of silence that protects their most delicate secrets as well.As the case evolves, it's not a pretty picture that is revealed behind the ""privileged"" walls of Bredgar Chambers.There's little to complain about with this book and much to praise.  There's a powerful subplot about the marriage of Simon Allcourt-St. James that nicely develops Simon and his wife as characters.  You also get a deep look into several other marriages and relationships.  Elizabeth George seems to be saying that as much as we crave intimacy with others; such intimacy will probably bring us more pain than pleasure or happiness.  That's a pretty downbeat message, and one that keeps the book from working quite as well as it could.  The lesson is that we have to perfect ourselves with another perfected person who shares a mutual attraction before we can achieve happy intimacy.  Even then, if we are not candid with one another . . . all bets are off!Ms. George is equally suspicious of physical attraction.  It only seems to lead to no good in this book.For fans of taut, challenging plotting, this book has few peers.  It's as though Ms. George wanted to move away from writing novels that contain mysteries into writing mysteries that reveal the darkest secrets of the human condition.  I defy any normal reader to sense the outcome of this book in all of its dimensions until right before the end.This book will haunt you the most if you read it on a dark and stormy night when unhappiness is poisoning your sleep.",4.0,The Code of Silence Destroys Lives!,1117497600.0,"05 31, 2005"

A2D9IEFJGB483Q,0061301221,Kendal B. Hunter,"[27, 31]","This is more of a reaction to Kierkegaard's  ""Works of Love"" than a review of the book.  I cannot perfect perfection.First, he hits the genius of Christianity, and take's Paul's chapter on Charity, 1 Corinthians 13 as the backbone text.  This is an impressive ""love poem"" which really explains why Christianity is so novel.  If you don't believe me, read pre-Christian literature, such as Socrates, Homer, or The Epic of Gilgamesh.  Pre-Christian society ignored human dignity and worth, and people were just functions of the state, or the whim of the king.Secondly, Kierkegaard recognizes that love is a work, and not merely a state of heart or a chattering point.  This notion of work is anathema to ""Pop Protestantism,"" which was Kierkegaard's mortal enemy.  He commented that the obsession with ""grace"" had turned Christianity upside-down, and had caused men to try and cheat God out of his religion.  This is another way of saying that faith without works is dead.Kierkegaard last insight is that God is the basis of love, which he underscores in the opening invocation.  Too many people gloss by this prefacing prayer, but that is what separates love and love with power.  God gives us power to love.I found this translation quite readable.  Soren, in any version, is rather thick, almost as if he is intentionally trying to hide things.  Part of difficulty comes from the dense 19th Century verbosity that was a token of the age.  However, his greatest asset is humorous illustrations, which helps mentally fix the points forever.The only criticism I have is that Kierkegaard does not connect love to the Atonement.  He does, in the introductory benediction, assert that we need to have love securely wedded to God, but he does not connect love to the Atonement and the Resurrection, the central doctrines of Christianity.This is Soren at his best, so I recommend that you begin your Danish journey here, then move on to ""Either/Or,"" ""Fear And Trembling,"" and ""Sickness Unto Death.""

Spencer does an incredible job presenting a story delving into one's psychological mind.  He goes into great depth showing how a relationship can be unhealthy and dangerous.  Its not a love story; it's a tale of how mental illness affects a man and the people around him: family, friends, and of course the loves of his life, Jade and her family.  There is a graphic sex scene I was surprised to see as well as controversial issues slightly covered such as racial stereotypes and integration, drug use and America's radical changes in the 60's and 70's.

A1WGAYG3GI7P5Y,B000NDFFFE,Ultimategamer,"[0, 0]","This is one of my favorite fighting games. What really intrigues me about Armageddon, as well as all the previous titles, is the story. I won't get into details, but it adds depth to what would otherwise be simply a game with a bunch of random people ripping other people's limbs off. The character roster is a huge plus; 63 fighters, plus your personal fighter you create. Each fighter has their own unique fighting styles and special moves. It's also cool to see that you can now fight in the air! My biggest complaint with the arcade mode was the character endings. The animations are virtually similar (each character ""dancing"" on top of a pyramid), with commentary being spoken. I miss the endings with artwork being displayed. The create-a-fatality feature is pretty cool, but it takes away some of the individuality of the characters, some of which have well-known finishing moves.The create-a-fighter feature is a really cool addition. I was always wanting to make my own personal fight to use in these games and am glad they finally made this feature. You can control every detail of your character, which I like. I kind of wish they included more options with the weapon your character uses (you can only use a limited number of swords and axes).The motor kombat mode is a great addition, giving you the option to race mortal kombat style. However, the character selection, as well as the track selection, is limited. While it is fun to see other racers flying of the track or getting squashed, it would have been nice to see more variety.Overall, I really liked this game.

Actually, I was pretty sure I wouldn't like it to be honest, as I'm no fan of Mr. Jobs. But something about the illustrated artwork on the cover, ironically, made me think the book might be more real. Together with the endorsement of a friend I decided to give it a try. Besides, I could always toss it aside if it fell into the usual laudatory tone of many other accounts of Steve's life and influence (especially now he has passed) right?I was pleasantly surprised.The book weaves in and out of Jobs' life as we know it - working at Apple and Next - to tell a lesser known story of influence that a relationship with a zen master , Kobun, had on Steve's life. A bit of a rebel himself, Kobun makes for an interesting character in his own right.With crafty penmanship and brush strokes the author and illustrator (the illustrators deserve as much credit for the storytelling in this book as the author) show us how the teachings of Kobun could have played an instrumental role in not only the way Steve lived his life but also designed his products. At one point, as Kobun is having Steve walk around in seemingly endless circles at a Zen sanctuary, the book reveals such a possible influence Kobun might have had on Steve. The book abruptly cuts away from the Zen sanctuary in the 1980s to a more recent Steve Jobs explaining to the Cupertino City Council his grand view for the new world headquarters of Apple. Steve uses the very same words that Kobun used to explain the power of the circle to him as he plodded around in circles at the Zen sanctuary in describing the circular design of the new campus. It's a beautiful and revealing moment. Even if it didn't happen exactly like that.It is contrasts like this between Steve's brass, power-seeking self and the calm and wise ways of Kobun that make the story quite delightful. It helps you see the human side of Steve and realize you, too, have two sides. It is at this moment, when you start to relate to Steve Jobs, that you realize the story has been quite effective.Well done folks. I look forward to your next book.

A3DE1IYJGU5HPW,B00005ASOH,Jason N. Mical,"[0, 2]","Perhaps one of the quintessential 1980s horror films, House makes its explosion onto the DVD format in this (relatively unadvertised) Anchor Bay Special/Limited Edition disc.  The digital gurus at Anchor Bay's studios have given us another finely restored film, and the first 20,000 DVDs produced are actual limited editions with a bonus DVD that contains a restored House II: The Second Story.  Fans, be speedy: these two-disc sets aren't going to last long, and this is House II's ONLY anticipated Region 1 release on DVD, ever.  Once it's gone, it's gone.But, is the 2 disc set even worth getting?  House tells the story of Vietnam vet and writer Roger Cobb (William Katt) who, looking for solitude and a break from his ex-wife (Kay Lenz), decides to move into his aunt's old house after she commits suicide.  Coincidentally, this is the same house where Cobb's son disappeared a couple of years ago - apparently one of the deciding factors in the divorce, and Cobb's current writing slump.  After he checks in, all manner of strange things happen, from Vietnam flashbacks to ghostly goings-on.As a horror film, House certainly holds its own against more serious slasher-fare.  Like Sam Raimi's Evil Dead, House doesn't take itself as seriously as other movies in the genre, and the result is an oftentimes humorous piece of work (unintentionally or not).  The horror elements are strong: you are never completely sure if the house is actually causing the events, or if the main character is slowly going insane.  Unfortunately, the story is so disjointed that the main creep value is lost when baddies are revealed too early, and the final sequence turns into an action movie instead of a horror film.  While farces aren't intended to be subtle, the subtle, layered effect created in the first 20 minutes is utterly ruined as soon as we see the monster, and from there on out everything either becomes more stereotypical 80s horror fare, or the comic version of the same.  This problem doesn't render House unwatchable, but it certainly detracts, as if the director couldn't quite make up his mind about what way he wanted the movie to go.The DVD, on the other hand, is fantastic.  The sound, while in mono, is clear and crisp, and the video transfer is remarkable (although anything less from Anchor Bay would be a crime).  The commentary track is loads of fun, and a 12-minute featurette on The Making of House provides a little historical context and amusement, too.  Luckily, Anchor Bay didn't spare the bonus House II disc any of their normal bells and whistles, and again the sound (mono as well) is great along with the near-flawless video.  The bonus disc also contains a full-length commentary which isn't nearly as entertaining as the other, but hey, neither is the movie.  Fans of House (and House II, if anyone is willing to admit to it) will definitely want to get the Limited Edition as soon as possible, because House II is going to be gone for good once it sells out.  Otherwise, if you liked House, and know what to expect from Anchor Bay, you know what to do - and at this price, it's hard not to.",3.0,Ding Dong!,996969600.0,"08 5, 2001"

But Morrow is far too clever to simply stack the deck.  He illustrates how the dangers of arrogance and close-mindedness and jealousy  can be employed for the worst possible reasons by a scientist as well as witchfinder (as someone with more than one family member who has suffered at the hands of the arrogance and ignorance perpetuated by some in the medical and pharmaceutical community I appreciate his even-handedness and honesty).  Beyond the central notions that drive the story, Morrow has woven a wonderful plot, filled with rich characters.  He has clearly researched the history of the period and employs real persons and events with great success.  The passages in the book that deal with a character's abduction and subsequent adoption by Native Americans were particularly compelling.  Reading this account of an English person's slow morph into aboriginal culture was extraordinarily inisghtful and evocative.  But then, with Morrow, the reader is dealing with a master of language.

But overall, I was intrigued to learn a little about the life of a pirate at that time in history, and profoundly grateful not to have been one!

I've bought gloves at the grocery store and even bought a different pair here online. I haven't been able to find anything that really fits and is suitable for washing dishes.

They even smell good. This pair has a fragrant powder that smells just like vanilla pudding. Weird, but cool.My only complaint is that these gloves are really snug. My hands aren't very big at all. Most of these gloves are designed for women's slender hands. Even though my hands are fairly medium, these large gloves still seem really small. They're OK for me though--I'll make out OK.Make sure and rinse them when you're done and hang them to dry. They should last for awhile.

Sisk ""author of SF thriller PleshaCore""","[0, 0]","I've owned and used this Netbook for 2 months and it meets most all of my requirements: inexpensive, decent battery charge duration, sharp screen, (mostly) full-sized keys, lightweight, small but un-cramped keyboard (with a couple exceptions).I'm using this primarily as a word processor while mobile. I do use it also for light web browsing and some non-HD video streaming. With proper power settings (and limited video watching) it's  easy to get nearly the advertised battery life (I'm getting 5 to 6.5 hours per charge). Power consumption is, as with all mobile devices, a matter of compromise. If you insist on watching HD videos all the time with your brightness set to max, well, sorry but you're going to eat up a lot of power quickly. Cut back on the brightness and use it for less graphically intensive tasks and the power consumption goes way down. Just the way it is. For me, 5 to 6 hours of charge is more than enough for my weekend writing sessions over big cups of coffee.The only two real issues I have with this Netbook are these: the touchpad and the Page Up/Page Down keys.The touchpad is a bit fiddly. It's at once overly sensitive and belligerent (single and double clicking on it is kind of a hit or miss operation), and because it sits exactly where the palms of my hands want to rest while typing, I'm constantly--and I mean constantly--accidentally touching it. Suddenly the cursor is nowhere close to where I want it to be and I'm inserting text in the middle of words elsewhere in my document. That is annoying.Just as annoying is the location of the Page Up and Page Down keys. They sit to the left and right of the Up arrow. The way I write, I'm constantly using the Up, Down, Left and Right arrows. Because all these keys are extremely undersized, crammed close together with the Page keys, I'm always hitting Page Up or Down instead of the Left or Right arrow keys.I suppose the answer to both of these design flaws (and honestly it's kind of hard to imagine how a design could be made without these issues given the small footprint of this machine) would be to just get a mouse. I'll eventually do that, but it's an extra cost and an extra bit of gear to carry around when you're mobile.Other than those problems, this device is exactly what I was looking for.",4.0,Does what I wanted.,1357689600.0,"01 9, 2013"

I added an adhesive pen loop inside the binding, which I use for a stylus.

I also noted that applying filters impacts the stats results which may not necessarily be intuitive.My only critique would be from an organizational perspective I think it might be useful to talk about all of the layout options, strategies and goals up front.
